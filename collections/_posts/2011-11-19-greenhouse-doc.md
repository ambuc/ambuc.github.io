This is a report Michael Clark, Nick Jones, Chase Kauffman, Thomas Mayo-Smith,
Cory Nissly, and I compiled in Summer 2011, as part of the _Cornell Summer
College_ program at Cornell Univeristy, in Ithaca, NY. As part of the report, we
performed a thorough economic analysis on potential locations, a small amount of
construction rendering and CAD, a thermodynamic analysis of energy balance and
thermal conductivity, and a model circuit.

#### Abstract:

> The recent discoveries involving carbon emissions and global warming have led
> to worldwide concern for more “green” ways of producing goods and energy; our
> team has been researching and conceptually designing a “green” greenhouse, to
> produce crops in an energy efficient and environmentally friendly manner. In a
> modern world, where capitalist democratic policies reign in most civilized
> countries, it is important to understand global concerns and to adapt business
> and production methods to what the world needs, collectively. In this,
> pursuing this “green” greenhouse was a legitimate business endeavor as well as
> an attempt to meet the world’s desires.
>
> Since different geographical locations all have their respective crops,
> prices, and growing seasons, it was important to understand what the people
> wanted and where that product could be grown cheaply. Our team researched the
> prices of crops in different places, the prices of land in different
> countries, the efficiency of each location’s growing seasons, and many other
> factors of the business end of things. As a result of the geographical
> information that we reviewed, we decided that the best location for a
> greenhouse would be the Dominican Republic for its cheap land and climate
> stability. Our economic research into the construction and energy costs of a
> greenhouse yielded a very efficient rectangular model, designed to maximize
> sun time and climate stability on minimal energy usage and pollution. Our crop
> research showed that the most economically feasible crops were Garlic Chives,
> Cilantro, Spinach, Poinsetta, and Orchid. Given all of this information and
> the calculated results that constituted them, the T14 group has constructed a
> very comprehensive array of graphs and statistics, a physical scale-model of
> their future greenhouse, a detailed and very accurate computer aided design of
> the model to portray it for the public in a reasonable fashion.
>
> The implications of this very well thought out design are that these ideas are
> completely feasible. It has overarching energy, economic, and environmental
> implications for the future that are relatively astounding. With the proper
> research, motivation, funding and willpower this new greenhouse just may be
> the future of crops and the water to douse the fire of global energy demands.
