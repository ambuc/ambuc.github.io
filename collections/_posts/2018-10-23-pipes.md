# Introduction
This project remakes the game [_Pipe
Mania_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipe_Mania) in Haskell using [Brick, a
declarative terminal user interface
library](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/brick) and [box-drawing
characters](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/brick), which are a form of
semigraphics for drawing lines and rectangles. _Pipe Mania_ comes in many forms, 
such as an updated [Metro design](https://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50223.9007199266530569.85ca83ac-8716-441b-ac8f-274104073aa0.f8d28383-fd79-4aab-a895-d0a3bcc26f0c?w=672&h=378&q=80&mode=letterbox&background=%23FFE4E4E4&format=jpg), 
a vintage [Windows 95 theme](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DkV8PqlMwNc/hqdefault.jpg), 
and [online flash game](https://img-hws.pog.com/cloud/y8-thumbs/30894/big.jpg).
Each variant is slightly different, so I didn't really copy any one game in
particular.

You can browse the source at
[github.com/ambuc/pipes](https://github.com/ambuc/pipes), but this post will be
a short walkthrough of the most interesting parts of its development.

# Graphics
_Pipes_ runs in the terminal, consumes keyboard events, and redraws a screen full
of Unicode characters every frame. [Box
Drawing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_Drawing) characters are used to
render empty/full, connected/isolated pipes at all angles and thicknesses. These
characters have been around since v1.0.0 ([October
1991](https://www.unicode.org/history/publicationdates.html)) and are commonly
used for drawing terminal interfaces such as
[`tmux`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmux).

How do we consume a tile and decide which character to draw? In our case, we
have more data than which legs are absent or present -- we want to have control
over each of the four limbs, and we want to dictate whether that limb is absent,
present, or present and bold.

## Braille 

In Unicode, [Braille patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braille_Patterns)
are encoded in a sensible way. There are typically six dots, but there can be as
many as eight. Those dots are indexed like so:

    Indexing   Base 16
    ========   =========
    (1) (4)    ( 1) ( 8)
    (2) (5)    ( 2) (10)
    (3) (6)    ( 4) (20)
    (7) (8)    (40) (80)

So, for example, the Unicode position of the character ⠓ (which has dots 1, 2,
and 5 raised) can be computed by taking the sum of the hexidecimal powers of two
which correspond with the desired inputs, plus some offset, like so:

<center>
$[1,2,5] \rightarrow \Sigma [1_{16},2_{16},10_{16}] \rightarrow 13_{16}
\rightarrow (2800_{16} + 13_{16}) \rightarrow \text{U+2813} \rightarrow
\boxed{⠓}$
</center>

This is only possible because the Unicode characters are ordered
lexicographically:

      Code Point  Character  Dots   Binary
      ==========  =========  =====  ========
          U+2801  ⠁              1  00000001
          U+2802  ⠂              2  00000010
          U+2803  ⠃            1,2  00000011
          U+2804  ⠄              3  00000100

## Box-Drawing Characters

This is not the case for box-drawing characters, which are grouped primarily by
shape, secondarily by rotation, and tertiarily by thickness.

              0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F

      U+250x  ─ ━ │ ┃ ┄ ┅ ┆ ┇ ┈ ┉ ┊ ┋ ┌ ┍ ┎ ┏

      U+251x  ┐ ┑ ┒ ┓ └ ┕ ┖ ┗ ┘ ┙ ┚ ┛ ├ ┝ ┞ ┟

      U+252x  ┠ ┡ ┢ ┣ ┤ ┥ ┦ ┧ ┨ ┩ ┪ ┫ ┬ ┭ ┮ ┯

      U+253x  ┰ ┱ ┲ ┳ ┴ ┵ ┶ ┷ ┸ ┹ ┺ ┻ ┼ ┽ ┾ ┿

      U+254x  ╀ ╁ ╂ ╃ ╄ ╅ ╆ ╇ ╈ ╉ ╊ ╋ ╌ ╍ ╎ ╏

Given some input data like `{n: bold, e: absent, s: bold, w: regular}`, what is
our preferred schema? My answer was this:

    N  012012012012012012012012012012012012012012012012012012012012012012012012012012012
    E  0--1--2--0--1--2--0--1--2--0--1--2--0--1--2--0--1--2--0--1--2--0--1--2--0--1--2--
    S  0--------1--------2--------0--------1--------2--------0--------1--------2--------
    W  0--------------------------1--------------------------2--------------------------
        ╵╹╶└┖╺┕┗╷│╿┌├┞┍┝┡╻╽┃┎┟┠┏┢┣╴┘┚─┴┸╼┶┺┐┤┦┬┼╀┮┾╄┒┧┨┰╁╂┲╆╊╸┙┛╾┵┹━┷┻┑┥┩┭┽╃┯┿╇┓┪┫┱╅╉┳╈╋

So that we can convert our desired weights into an enum on $[0,1,2]$ and index
into some hard-coded `schema` string, like so:

`{n: bold, e: absent, s: bold, w: regular}` = $[2,0,2,1]$

$[2,0,2,1] \rightarrow \left( 2\cdot 3^0  + 0\cdot 3^1  + 2\cdot 3^2  +
1\cdot 3^3 \right) \rightarrow 47 \rightarrow \text{schema}[47] \rightarrow
\boxed{┨}$

So that's how _Pipes_ renders tiles of various orientations/thicknesses/shapes.

# Animation

One of the goals of writing this game was that it would not only respond to
cursor movement and rotation (the way all _Pipes Mania_-style games do) but that the
pipes which were connected to the drain, i.e. had water in them, would pulse
gently.

![Pipes](/assets/images/pipes/example-anim.gif)

This animation relies on tweening, which uses heterogeneous characters like `╼`
and `╾` in-between homogeneous characters like `─` and `━` to give the
appearance of finer-resolution motion. Here is an example:

    Horizontal         Vertical
    Locomotion        Locomotion
    ==========     =================
      0 ───        0 ½ 1 ½ 2 ½ 3 ½ 4  
      1 ╾──        │ ╿ ┃ ╽ │ │ │ │ │  
      2 ━──        │ │ │ ╿ ┃ ╽ │ │ │  
      3 ╼╾─        │ │ │ │ │ ╿ ┃ ╽ │  
      4 ─━─                    
      5 ─╼╾                    
 
When we explore the connected graph of pipes, we mark each limb as being an
inlet or an outlet and then generate the appropriate tile given both the
distance from the tap and the current time. This lets us stagger the animation
across the tile so that the water appears to flow in from the limb nearer to the
tap and flow out from the others.

# Conclusion

[Brick](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/brick) is the perfect framework for a
project like this. If you're interested in playing with [the
code](https://github.com/ambuc/pipes) (or even just
playing the game), you can get started by installing [Stack, the Haskell Tool
Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/#how-to-install) and
running:

    $ git@github.com:ambuc/pipes.git
    $ cd pipes
    $ stack build
    $ stack exec pipes-exe
