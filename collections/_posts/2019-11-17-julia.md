# Introduction

In anticipation of [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/) I decided to
brush up on [http://golang.org/](Golang). I had written a crypto (codebreaking,
not currency) library [in Go](https://github.com/ambuc/cryptgo) in 2016 but I
didn't remember much of it.

# The Julia set

The [Julia set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set) is a fractal. It can
be rendered by, for each point $(x,y)$ in a grid (ideally centered around
$(0,0)$), taking the complex number $z = x + iy$ and applying $f_c(z) = z^2 + c$
to it repeatedly until it escapes some threshold from the origin. The precise
values used are variable and somewhat open to artistic interpretation; in the
code below, we use $c = -0.8 + 0.156i$ and a threshold of $1.9$.

Here is a gif of the lower-right-hand-quadrant of the Julia set where each frame
has one more iteration of $f_c(z)$ than the previous one.

And here is the code which produces it:
