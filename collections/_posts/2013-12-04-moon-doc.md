WA dimensional analysis engine based on the [SI Base/Derived
Units](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI_base_unit). Uses input on the seven base
units (mass, distance, time, electric current, temperature, luminous intensity,
and amount of substance) to display many common derived units of measurement.
Basically a unit calculator.

Designed and built by [Julian](http://julianrosenblum.com/) and me.
