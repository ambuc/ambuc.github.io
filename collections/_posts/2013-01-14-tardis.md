While working at the Champaign-Urbana Community Fab Lab on a previous project, I
discovered a sheet of opalescent acrylic. At first transparent, it became
unpredictably multicolored when a light was shone through it. I decided it would
make a brilliant lamp.

I designed the TARDIS in Illustrator, modeling its proportions after whatever
photo references I could find. The edges are connected by well-toleranced finger
joints, and the entire body, including the base, are constructed without any
glue or sealant. The base was built using an LED, some resistors, and a single
D-cell battery.
