This is a report Jessica Malmberg and I compiled during the summer of 2015 under
the direction of [Dag Avango](https://www.kth.se/profile/avango/) and [Dr. Mark
Safstrom](http://www.germanic.illinois.edu/people/safstrom), as a part of the
course [AK1214  Environment and Society in a Changing
Arctic](http://www.kth.se/student/kurser/kurs/AK1214?l=en), hosted jointly by
_KTH_ in Stockholm and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

The course involved three weeks of lectures in Stockholm on the topic of
environmental and social change in the Arctic region, with an emphasis on
Norrbotten, Sweden, as well as two weeks of travel and field research in
Norrbotten, including on-site visits to
[Aitik](http://www.boliden.com/Operations/Mines/Aitik/),
[Malmberget](https://www.lkab.com/en/About-us/Overview/Operations-Areas/Malmberget/),
and
[Kiruna](https://www.lkab.com/en/About-us/Overview/Operations-Areas/Kiruna/), as
well as a stay at the [Tarfala Research
Station](http://www.natgeo.su.se/english/tarfala-research-station/tarfala-research-station-1.53731)
in the Tarfala Valley and visits to the [Sam√≠
Museum](http://www.ajtte.com/english/) in Jokkmokk, [Laponia](laponia.nu/)
national park, and other cultural heritage sites in Norrbotten.

The paper incorporates first-hand research into the environmental and social
impacts of mining, hydropower, industrialization, and the railway - together
known as the Norrbotten Technological Megasystem.
