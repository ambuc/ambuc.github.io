## Background

**Lion Wall** is an online game inspired by [*Only
Connect*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Only_Connect#Round_3:_Connecting_Wall),
a British TV quiz show. In the third round of *Only Connect*, contestants are
faced with a four-by-four grid of cards. These cards can be grouped into four
sets of four, where group is connected by some common thread.

![Connecting Wall](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Only_Connect_Round3_Unsolved.png)

An example "Connecting Wall" puzzle. The answer requires dividing the items
into "*Terms for zero*", "*Poker terms*", "*Flying ___*" and "*Things made of
rubber*".

### Red Herrings

To make the puzzle harder, some of the cards seem to belong to more than one
category. In the example above, the category "*Poker terms*" applies to
"[Deuce](https://www.pokerzone.com/dictionary/deuce)",
"[Bullet](https://www.pokerzone.com/dictionary/bullet)",
"[Crab](https://www.pokerzone.com/dictionary/crab)", and
"[Cowboy](https://www.pokerzone.com/dictionary/cowboy)". 

This category also seems as though it ought to apply to "Ace", but "Ace"
actually belongs to the category "*Flying ___*".

On *Only Connect*, these cards are called [red
herrings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_herring).

## Generalizing the _Connecting Wall_

I first wanted to lift this game out of the domain of English-language trivia. 

* Let each of [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] represent a category in the
  abstract.
  * The values [1, 2, 3, 4] will be special "real" categories. The others
    will be "red herring" categories.
* Let a card consist of an unordered list of categories. 
  * Each card must contain exactly one of [1, 2, 3, 4].

I constructed a generalized _Connecting Wall_ game:

```yaml
[ [ (1, 5), (1, 6), (1, 7), (1, 8) ]
, [ (2, 6), (2, 7), (2, 8), (2, 9) ]
, [ (3, 0), (3, 7), (3, 8), (3, 9) ]
, [ (4, 0), (4, 5), (4, 6), (4, 9) ]
]
```

such that the special "real" categories [1, 2, 3, 4] are mentioned in
exactly four cards each, with no overlaps, and the "red herring" categories
[0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] are mentioned in three or fewer cards each.

If we wanted to map this generalized game _back_ to an English-language
trivia game, the real categories [1, 2, 3, 4] might become ["*Terms for
zero*", "*Poker terms*", "*Flying ___*", "*Things made of rubber*"], and the
red herring categories might become more loosely-defined categories such as:

* "*Starts with B*" (Buttress, Bullet),
* "*Animal*" (Crab, Fox, Fish, Goose-egg?), or
* "*Contains a repeating letter*" (Goose-egg, Buttress, Bullet), etc.

## Specifying for CJK characters

Many CJK characters consist of two subcomponents: if we map each of the
categories 0-9 to a
[component](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangxi_radical), we can usually
find characters which contain only those two components.

### By hand

Before writing an automated solution, I stepped through the process of
assembling a valid puzzle by hand. I picked ten common radicals and mapped
them to the numbers 0-9:

```
0	九
1	疒
2	宀
3	犭
4	口
5	了
6	丁
7	主
8	由
9	示
```

Then, for each card in the generalized grid above, I tried to find a
character which matched:

```
15	疒了	疗
26	宀丁	宁
30	犭九	犰
40	口九	㕤
16	疒丁	疔
27	宀主	宔
37	犭主	㹥
45	口了	𠮩
17	疒主	疰
28	宀由	宙
38	犭由	㹨
46	口丁	叮
18	疒由	㾄
29	宀示	宗
39	犭示	狋
49	口示	呩
```

This got me a valid puzzle:

```
疗	宁	犰	㕤
疔	宔	㹥	𠮩
疰	宙	㹨	叮
㾄	宗	狋	呩
```

This puzzle is unshuffled as drawn above. You can see that each character in
the first row contains `疒`; each character in the second row contains `宀`;
then `犭`, then `口`.

### Automating

Similar to [AutoCJK](https://github.com/google/autocjk), I used the phenomenal resource
[IDS.TXT](https://www.babelstone.co.uk/CJK/IDS.TXT) as a backing dataset. I
reused the [decomposition
utilities](https://github.com/ambuc/autocjk/blob/main/src/utils/decomposer.py)
from AutoCJK which know how to read/parse `IDS.TXT`. In short, running
`decomposer.Decomposer()` returns a [networkx](https://networkx.org/)
[digraph](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable//reference/classes/digraph.html)
such that `子` and `宀` are ancestors of `字`, and vice versa for descendants.

Then I wrote this script to generate valid puzzles.

```py
from operator import itemgetter
from typing import *
import collections
import decomposer as decomposer_lib
import random


# Get the thirty most common radicals from the graph, weighted by how often
# they appear as subcomponents. (That's why we iterate thru predecessors(n)
# below.)
def most_common_radicals(graph) -> List[Text]:
    common = collections.defaultdict(int)
    for n in graph.nodes():
        for k in list(graph.predecessors(n)):
            common[k] += 1
    res = dict(sorted(common.items(), key=itemgetter(1), reverse=True)[:30])
    return list(res.keys())


# If a character is in the first Unicode CJK plane, it probably has a
# rendering in most web browsers. (This assumption is flawed.)
def has_rendering(i: int) -> bool:
    return 0x4E00 <= i <= 0x9FFF


# Given a character, find the set of characters with which it shares a descendant.
# Example: 宀 and 子 are coparents of 字.
def coparents(graph, node):  # returns set[node]
    cpts = set()
    for succ in graph.successors(node):
        if not has_rendering(ord(succ)):
            continue
        preds = list(graph.predecessors(succ))
        if len(preds) != 2:
            continue
        for pred in graph.predecessors(succ):
            if not has_rendering(ord(pred)):
                continue
            if pred != node:
                cpts.add(pred)
    return cpts


# Given two nodes, returns a list of successors they share.
def children(graph, na, nb):  # returns node
    s = set.intersection(set(graph.successors(na)), set(graph.successors(nb)))
    return list(filter(lambda c: has_rendering(ord(c)), list(s)))


class BoardBuilder:

    def __init__(self, graph):
        self._graph = graph
        # This is the default game described above.
        self._cells = [[[1, 5], [1, 6], [1, 7], [1, 8]],
                       [[2, 6], [2, 7], [2, 8], [2, 9]],
                       [[3, 0], [3, 7], [3, 8], [3, 9]],
                       [[4, 0], [4, 5], [4, 6], [4, 9]], ]
        # Store our selected categories below.
        self._extant = set()

    def Build(self):
        # Pick four "real categories".
        [a, b, c, d] = random.sample(most_common_radicals(self._graph), 4)
        # Assign these categories.
        [self.assign(n, l) for n, l in zip([1, 2, 3, 4], [a, b, c, d])]
        # Assign the red herring categories.
        [self.assign(n, self.find_assignment(n)) for n in [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0]]

        for r_idx, row in enumerate(self._cells):
            for c_idx, [a, b] in enumerate(row):
                # Pick a random descendant shared by the two components.
                self._cells[r_idx][c_idx] = random.sample(
                    children(self._graph, a, b), 1)[0]

        return self._cells

    def assign(self, num, ch):
        # Replace all instances of |num| with |ch| in self._cells.
        for r_idx, row in enumerate(self._cells):
            for c_idx, cell in enumerate(row):
                for v_idx, v_val in enumerate(cell):
                    if v_val == num:
                        self._cells[r_idx][c_idx][v_idx] = ch
        self._extant.add(ch)

    # Given a category, what other categories share a card with it?
    # Example: In the example above, neighbors(1) => [5,6,7,8].
    def neighbors(self, num):
        others = []
        for r_idx, row in enumerate(self._cells):
            for c_idx, cell in enumerate(row):
                if num not in cell:
                    continue
                others.append(list(filter(lambda n: n != num, cell))[0])
        return others
    
    # For our red herring categories, find a CJK character which can sit in for
    # |num|, i.e. is a coparent with each of the neighbors.
    def find_assignment(self, num):
        others = self.neighbors(num)
        coparents_list = [coparents(self._graph, o) for o in others]
        candidates = set.intersection(*coparents_list)
        candidates -= self._extant
        return random.sample(list(candidates), 1)[0]


if __name__ == "__main__":
    d = decomposer_lib.Decomposer()
    for row in BoardBuilder(d._graph).Build():
        print(row)
```

Running this script generates a valid, unshuffled puzzle such as
`窠窒岤空洷溄江沚食仚仝企踉踝跮趾`.

## Making the game

Then I wrote a webpage which could consume these puzzles and display them in
an interactive format. You can visit
[https://jbuckland.com/games/lionwall.html](https://jbuckland.com/games/lionwall.html)
to play the game or you can view the [source of the
webpage](https://github.com/ambuc/ambuc.github.io/blob/master/games/lionwall.html)
to see how it works.

### Semaphores

I wanted cards to animate (flip over, fade out, wait, reappear at the top of
the page), but I didn't want the UI to be interactive during those times. So
I wrote a [semaphore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaphore_(programming))
to ensure that the UI could not be changed while animations or timeouts were
ongoing. My solution was a global counter `semaphore` and two methods:

- a `sleep()` timeout which incremented the semaphore, ran the callback, then
  waited until it was done to decrement the semaphore, and
- a `ensureSemaphoreZero()` blocker which waited until `semaphore` was 0
  until running.

```js
var semaphore = 0

function ensureSemaphoreZero() {
    return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
        (function waitForSemaphoreZero() {
            if (semaphore == 0) return resolve();
            setTimeout(waitForSemaphoreZero, 10);
        })();
    });
}

const sleep = (milliseconds) => {
    semaphore++
    return new Promise(resolve => {
        setTimeout(resolve, milliseconds)
    }).then(() => {
        semaphore--
    })
}
```

This let me chain sleep callbacks for running spaced-out animations:

```js
sleep(100).then(() => {
    // Manipulate the webpage.
    sleep(100).then(() => {
        // Once that's done, manipulate the webpage again.
    })
})
```

But also react to keystrokes in a blocking way:

```js
function onClickCallback() {
    ensureSemaphoreZero().then(() => {
        // React to callback.
    });
}
```

## Future work

I generated ~100 games for [Lion
Wall](https://jbuckland.com/games/lionwall.html) but I ought to go back and
generate more. I could also make this game more like the *Only Connect*
version, with a timer, limited guesses, and extra points for specifying the
connecting themes.
