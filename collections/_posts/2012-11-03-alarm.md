In my first semester as a Freshman at Illinois, I took IEFX Projects, an ENG 198
course focused on letting students work on their own self-assigned projects to
completion.

This fully automated alarm clock, which I built with Chris Marry and Steve
Hefferman as a final project for ENG 198:
[IEFX](http://iefx.engineering.illinois.edu/), can turn the rod on a set of
venetian blinds to let in the sunlight in the morning. My responsibilities were
to construct the circuit board and program an Arduino backend to mirror the
functions of a real alarm clock.
