> Consider the binary relation $R = \\{(n, n+1) \mid n \in \Z\\} \subseteq \Z
> \times \Z$.
> 
> **a)** What is the equivalence relation generated by $R$?

$R=\\{(n,n+1)\mid n\in\Z\\}$ generates the equivalence relation $S_R$ which 
covers the whole plane $\Z\times\Z$. Since $S_R$ is an equivalence relation, for
any $x\in\Z$, $(x,x)\in S_R$. But since $S_R$ contains $R$, $S_R$ also contains
$(x, x+1)$. Finally, since $S_R$ contains $(x, x+1)$ and $(x+1, x+2)$, $S_R$
also contains $(x, x+2)$ and so on and so forth.
 
> **b)** How many equivalence classes are there?

$\aleph_0$.
