> Let $F$ be a vector field on $\R^2$. Recall that for two points $x,x'\in\R^2$,
> any curve $C$ with endpoints $x$ and $x'$, and any parameterization
> $r:[a,b]\to C$, the line integral $\int_C F(r)\cdot dr$ returns a real number.
> It does not depend on $r$, except its orientation (direction). Therefore, if
> we think of $C$ as having an orientation, say going from $x$ to $x'$, then
> $\int_C F$ is a well-defined real number. If C goes from $x$ to $x'$, let's
> suggestively write $C:x\to X'$. Define an equivalence relation $\sim$ on the
> set of oriented curves in $\R^2$ by saying $C\sim C'$ if 
>
> - $C$ and $C'$ start at the same point,
> - $C$ and $C'$ end at the same point, and
> - $\int_C F = \int\_{C'} F$.
>
> Suppose we try to make a category ${\mathcal{C}}\_F$ as follows. 
>
> Put $\text{Ob}(\mathcal{C}\_{F}) = \R^2$, and for every pair of points $x,
> x'\in\R^2$, let $\text{Hom}\_{\mathcal{C}\_F}(x,x') = \\{C:x\to x'\\} /
> \sim$, where $C: x\to x'$ is an oriented curve and $\sim$ means "same line
> integral", as explained above.
>
> Is there an identity morphism and a composition formula that will make
> $\mathcal{C}\_F$ into a category?
