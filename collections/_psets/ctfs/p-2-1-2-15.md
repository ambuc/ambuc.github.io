> **a)** Let $A = \\{a,b,c,d\\}$. If $f: \underline{10} \to A$ is given by
> $(a,b,c,c,b,a,d,d,a,b)$, what is $f(4)$?

Since $\underline{n} := \\{1,2,3...n\\}$, where $f(n)$ is the $n$th element
in the sequence given by $f$, $f(4) = c$.

> **b)** Let $s: \underline{7} \to \N$ be given by $s(i) = i^2$. Write $s$ out
> as a sequence.

$s: \underline{7} \to \N = (1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2, 6^2, 7^2)$
$= (1,4,9,16,25,36,49)$.
