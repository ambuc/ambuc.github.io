> True or false: a partial order is a preorder that has no cliques. (If false,

A partial order is a preorder where $\dfrac{s\leqslant s' \qquad s'\leqslant
s}{s=s'}$. A clique is a subset $S' \subseteq S$ such that for each $a,b\in S'$
one has $a \leqslant b$, where $a \neq b$. 

Let us assume $S'$ is a partial order on $S$ which has a clique $\\{a,b\\}$.
Since $\\{a,b\\}$ is a clique, we know both $a \leqslant b$ and $b \leqslant a$.
But sicnce $S$ is a partial order, we know $a = b$. Thus there is no pair of
distinct elements $\\{a,b\\}$ constituting a clique.

True, a partial order can have no cliques.
