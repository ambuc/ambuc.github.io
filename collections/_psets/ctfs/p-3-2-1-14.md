> _a)_ Consider the $U(1)$ action on $\R^3$ given in Example $3.2.1.10$.
> Describe the set of orbits of this action.

Given group $G$ acting on set $X$, for a point $x\in X$, the _orbit of x_ is:

$$Gx := \{x'\in X \mid \exists g \in G \text{ such that } gx=x' \}$$

Taking $U(1)$ on a point $p := (x,y,z) \in \R^3$ generates a circle parallel to
the $xy$-plane and centered about the $z$-axis; that circle has a radius
$\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.


> _b)_ What are the orbits of the action of the permutation group
> $\Sigma\_{\\{1,2,3\\}}$ on the set $\\{1,2,3\\}$? (See Exercise 3.2.1.11.)

There is only one orbit, since any point in $\Sigma\_{\\{1,2,3\\}}$ can reach
any other point via a single permutation.
