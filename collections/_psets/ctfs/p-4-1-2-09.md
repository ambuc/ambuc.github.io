> In Proposition 4.1.2.8 we gave a functor $P: \textbf{PrO}\to\textbf{Grph}$.
>
> _a)_ Is every graph $G\in\text{Ob}(\textbf{Grph})$ in the image of $P$ (or
> more precisely, is the function $\text{Ob}(P): \text{Ob}(\textbf{PrO}) \to
> \text{Ob}(\textbf{Grph})$ surjective)?
>
> _b)_ If so, why; if not, name a graph not in the image.
>
> _c)_ Suppose that $G,H\in\text{Ob}(\textbf{Grph})$ are two graphs that are in
> the image of $P$. Is every graph homomorphism $f:G\to H$ in the image of
> $\text{Hom}\_P$? In other words, does every graph homomorphism between $G$ and
> $H$ come from a preorder homomorphism?
