> example 3.1.2.3. Using a nice small generating set for the monoid, write out
> the corresponding action table.

Recall the action given in 3.1.2.3:

$$ S = \{0,1,2,...,11\} \qquad N = (\N,0,+) $$

$$ \hookrightarrow : \N\times S\to S $$

$$ \hookrightarrow(n,s) = n\hookrightarrow s = n + s \pmod{12} $$

    Addition modulo twelve
      N ||  0 |  1 
     ---++----+----
      0 ||  0 |  1 
      1 ||  1 |  2
      : ||  : |  :
     10 || 10 | 11
     11 || 11 |  0

Because the monoid in question is $N = (\N,0,+)$, the action table only has two
columns; $x\mapsto x+0$ and $x\mapsto x+1$. Adding a number $n$ can be seen as
adding $1$, $n$ times.
