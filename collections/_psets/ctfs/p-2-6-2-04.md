While it would be harder to intuit from piecewise definitions of $f:W\to X$ and
$g:W\to Y$, the diagram above makes it clear that all the nodes in $X$, $W$, and
$Y$ are a single connected component, i.e. $x_1 \sim w_1 \sim y_1 \sim w_3 \sim
x_3 \sim w_4 \sim y_2 \sim w_2 \sim x_2$. Thus the cardinality of any pushout $P
\stackrel{\cong}{\to} X \sqcup_W Y$ will have $\abs{P} = 1$.
