> Consider the partial order from Example (3.4.1.3). 

$$
\xymatrix{
  ♢\ar[dr] & ♡\ar[d] && ♧ \ar[d] & ♤\ar[dl] \\
  4♢\ar[u]\ar[d] & \text{red}\ar[dr] && \text{black}\ar[dl] & \text{black queen}\ar[l] \ar[d] \\
  4 \ar[r] &\text{numbered} \ar[r] & \text{a card} & \text{face} \ar[l] &\text{queen} \ar[l]
}
$$

> _a)_ If possible, find two elements in the partial order from Example 3.4.1.3
> that do not have a meet.


$$ ♢ \wedge ♡  = \emptyset $$. These are parallel notions, and there are no
elements which express both diamond-ness and heart-ness.

> _b)_ If possible, find two elements that do not have a join (in that
> preorder).

I don't think this is possible -- ultimately all elements join at $\text{"a
card"}$.
