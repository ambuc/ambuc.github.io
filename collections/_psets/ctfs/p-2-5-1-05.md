> **a)** Suppose that $Y = \emptyset$, what can you say about $X \times_Z Y$?

$Y = \emptyset \implies X\times_Z Y = \emptyset$ since there are no elements
in $Y$ such that $g(y) \in Z$.

> **b)** Suppose now that $Y$ is any set but that $Z$ has exactly one element,
> what can you say about $X\times_Z Y$?

If $Y$ is any set but $\abs{Z} = 1$, then every z-value in the fiber product will
be the same middle value $z$.
