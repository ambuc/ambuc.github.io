> _a)_ List all the preorder relations possible on the set $\\{1,2\\}$.

There are four possible preorder relations on a set of size two:

    m | n    m | n    m | n    m | n
    ==+==    ==+==    ==+==    ==+==
    1 | 1    1 | 1    1 | 1    1 | 1
             1 | 2             1 | 2
                      2 | 1    2 | 1
    2 | 2    2 | 2    2 | 2    2 | 2

All preorder relations must contain $(1,1)$ and $(2,2)$, since preorders are
reflexive. 

> _b)_ For any $n\in\N$, how many linear orders exist on the set
> $\\{1,2,3,...n\\}$?

It seems there are as many linear orders on a set of size $n$ as there are
permutations of $\\{1,2,3,...n\\}$, i.e. $n!$.

> _c)_ Does your formula work when $n=0$?

Yes, since $0! = 1$, and there is one possible preorder, $\\{\\}$.
