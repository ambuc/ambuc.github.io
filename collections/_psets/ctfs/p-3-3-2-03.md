> How many paths are there in the following graph?
>
> $$ \xymatrix{ \bullet^1 \ar[r]^f & \bullet^2 \ar[r]^g & \bullet^3 } $$

Paths can be of length 0; since $\text{Path}^{(0)}\_G \cong V$, there are
$\abs{V} = 3$ paths of length 0.  Paths can be of length 1; since
$\text{Path}^{(1)}\_G \cong A$, there are $\abs{A} = 2$ paths of length 1.
There is only one path of length 2, $1f2g3$, and there are no paths of length 3.
So there are 6 paths.
