The fiber sum $X \sqcup_R X$ is the set of objects in $X$ which are equivalent
across $\sim_R$, i.e. $\\{x \mid (x,x) \in R$, i.e. $\pi_1(R)$. Because the
equivalence relation $R$ is symmetric, any two objects in $x_1 \sim x_2 \forall
x_1, x_2 \in X \sqcup_R X$.

If $R_2$ is not an equivalence relation, there is no guarantee that $\pi_1\circ
i \cong \pi_2\circ i$. So the new pushout $X \sqcup_{R_2} X$ is the disjoint sum
of all elements which appear on either side of any pair of values in $R_2$.
This new $R_2$ also generates an equivalence relation $R_{2, \text{gen}}$. We
can infer that the fiber sum on $R_2$ is a subset of the fiber sum on $R_{2,
\text{gen}}$.
