For the set $S$, we can form a monoid given:

 - the identity element is $\id_S = f(s) = s \quad \forall s \in S$. 
 - the multiplication formula for two permutations $f_1, f_2: S\stackrel\cong\to
   S$ is their composition $(f_1 \star f_2)(s) = f_1(f_2(s))$.

For any permutation $p$, it is true that

 - $p \star e = e \qquad p \star \id_S = p(\id_S(s)) = p(s) = p$
 - $e \star p = e \qquad \id_S \star p = \id_S(p(s)) = p(s) = p$
 - $(m\star n)\star p = m \star (n \star p)$.

>  _b)_ Is it a group?

Since a permutation is a bijection, it is invertible, so any element $m\in M$
has an inverse $m'\in M$ suh that $m\star m' = e = m' \star m$. Thus the set of
permutations of $S$ forms a group.
