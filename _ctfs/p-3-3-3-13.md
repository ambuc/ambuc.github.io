The operation of relation-to-graph-to-relation is lossless, and the resultant
relation is identical.

The operation of graph-to-relation-to-graph is lossy, since the original graph
might have had sets of arrows which shared sources and targets. Encoding those
arrows into a set of pairs loses the cardinality of those sets, and the restored
graph only has one arrow instead.
