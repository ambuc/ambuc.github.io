> Let $X$ be a set and consider the group of permutations of $X$ (see Exercise
> 3.2.1.7), which we will denote $\Sigma_X$. Find a canonical action of
> $\Sigma_X$ on $X$.

An action of $\Sigma_X$ on $X$ is a function $\hookrightarrow: \Sigma_X \times X
\to X$ such that 

 - $\id_{X} \hookrightarrow s = s$, and 
 - $g \hookrightarrow (g' \hookrightarrow s) = (g \star g') \hookrightarrow s$,
   for all $g, g' \in \Sigma_X$, for all $s \in S$.

Here the canonical action of $\Sigma_X$ on $X$ is the application of an element
in $\Sigma_X$, i.e. the "application" of a permutation $f: X \stackrel\cong\to
X$ on the set $X$. 

(What is meant by "canonical"? There are other ways to apply a permutation, i.e.
one could imagine a group action which applies the inverse of each permutation.
The identity laws still hold, and it would still constitute a group action, but
because it requires a choice to "mis-apply" the permutation, it is not
"canonical".)
