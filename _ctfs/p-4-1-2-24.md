> Suppose that $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ are categories, $c,c'\in
> \text{Ob}(\mathcal{C})$ are objects, and $F:\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{D}$ is a
> functor. Suppose that $c$ and $c'$ are isomorphic in $\mathcal{C}$. Show that
> this implies that $F(c)$ and $F(c')$ are isomorphic in $\mathcal{D}$.
