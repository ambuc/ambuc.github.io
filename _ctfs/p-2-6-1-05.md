$R$ is the equality operation on elements of $x$; equality is:
 - reflexive: $x = x \quad\forall x \in X$, 
 - symmetric: $x = y \implies y = x \quad\forall x,y\in X$, and 
 - transitive: $x = y \text{ and } y = z \implies x = z \quad\forall x,y,z\in
   X$.

So $R$ is an equivalence relation.

Surely all equivalence _classes_ on $X$ are obtainable as the partition of a set
$X$; a partition can be seen as a function $X\to I$, where $I$ is the set of all
equivalence classes on $X$. (i.e. a partition $p(x) \mapsto i, x\in X, i\in I$.)

Since an equivalence relation is an instance of an equivalence class which obeys
some properties, all equivalence relations are obtainable in this way.
