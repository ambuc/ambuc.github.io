> (Binary relations to graphs).
>
> _a)_ If $R\subseteq S\times S$ is a binary relation, find a natural way to
> make a graph out of it, having vertices $S$.
>
> _b)_ What is the set $A$ of arrows?
>
> _c)_ What are the source and target functions $\text{src}, \text{tgt}: A\to
> S$?
>
> _d)_ Take the left-hand table in (3.9) and consider its first seven rows (i.e.
> forget the "..."). Draw the corresponding graph (do you see a tetrahedron?).
>
> _e)_ Do the same for the right-hand table.
