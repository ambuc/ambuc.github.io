> **a)** Realize the set $T := [0,12) \subseteq \R$ as the coequalizer of a pair
> of arrows $\R \rightrightarrows \R$.

Recall the coequalizer of two categories:

$$
\require{AMScd}
\begin{CD}
X @>{f}>{g}> Y @>{q}>> \text{Coeq}(f,g)
\end{CD}
$$

where $\text{Coeq}(f,g) := Y / f(x)\sim g(x)$.

Given a function $m:\R\to\R = x \pmod{12}$, we can realize $T$ as the
coequalizer of $\id_\R$ and $m$:

$$
\require{AMScd}
\begin{CD}
\R @>{\id_\R}>{m}> \R @>{i}>> T
\end{CD}
$$

such that $T = [0,12) \subseteq\R = \R / \id_\R \sim m$.

> **b)** For any $x \in \R$, realize the mapping $x \cdot - : T \to T$, implied
> by Example 3.1.2.3, using the universal property of coequalizers.

Recall the universal property for coequalizers:

$$
\require{AMScd}
\begin{CD}
X @>{f}>{g}> Y @>{\text{Coeq}}>>  C \\
@.           @. \diagdownarrow{n} @VV{\exists! u}V \\
@.           @.                   O
\end{CD}
$$

i.e. if $\text{Coeq}$ and $n$ are both coequalizers of $f$ and $g$, there must
exist a unique mapping $u$ between their codomains. Here that mapping $u$ is the
same $x\cdot - : T\to T$ implied in the question.

> **c)** Prove that it is an action.

Rewriting this mapping as $\cdot : \R\times T \to T$, we realize this is an
$\R$-action on $T$. (i.e. $\R$ is the monoid and $T$ is the set.)

To be a valid action, it must be the case that:

 - $0 \cdot t = t \quad \forall t \in T$.   
    - We can rewrite this as $0_\R + t = t \quad\forall t \in T$.
    - Since any $t\in T$ is also a $t\in \R$, this is equivalent to an identity
      law on the monoid $(\R, 0, +)$.
 - $m \cdot (n \cdot t) = (m\star n) \cdot t \quad \forall m,n \in \R, t \in T$.  
    - We can rewrite this as 
      $m + (n + t \pmod{12}) \pmod{12} = (m + n) + t \pmod{12}$.
      Modular arithmetic laws show both of these are equal to $m + n + t
      \pmod{12}$.
