> Let $X$ be the set of people on earth; define a binary relation $R \subseteq X
> \times X$  on $X$ as follows. For a pair $(x,y)$ of people, say $(x,y) \in R$
> if $x$ spends a lot of time thinking about $y$. Is this relation reflexive?
> Symmetric? Transitive?

$R$ is not reflexive, since it is not the case that a person necessarily spends
a lot of time thinking about themselves. $R$ is not symmetric, since it is
possible for $x$ to think about $y$ without $y$ thinking about $x$. And $R$ is
not transitive, since it is possible for there to be a person $x$ who doesn't
think about a person $z$ but does think about a person $y$, who thinks about
$z$.
