> In Exercise 3.1.1.27 you classified the cyclic monoids. Which of them are
> groups?

Only one cyclic monoid is a group, the monoid with only one element and one
morphism from that element to itself. That element $e$ has the inverse $e$, such
that $e \star e = e$, and such that $e \star (e \star e) = (e \star e) \star e$.

This is a degenerate case, and there are are no other cyclic monoids which are
groups. Groups need an inverse element $m'\in M$ for every element $m\in M$ such
that $m \star m' = e = m' \star m$, but a cyclic monoid has $e$ as its initial
object and no morphisms terminating in $e$. (The one exception is the cyclic
monoid $\\{1\\}$ discussed above.)
