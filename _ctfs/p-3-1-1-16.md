The free monoid generated by $\\{1\\}$ is:

$$M := (\list(\{1\}),\lbrack\ \rbrack,++)$$

where $\list(\\{1\\})$ is the set of lists of elements where each element is
$1$.

> **b)** What is the free monoid generated by $\emptyset$?

We can see that the free monoid generated by $\emptyset$:

$$ M := (\list(\emptyset), \lbrack\ \rbrack, ++) $$

is defined on $\list(\emptyset)$, which is the set of lists which can be made
from no elements.

There is only one list which can be made from no elements, the _empty list_.

So $\list(\emptyset) := \\{\lbrack\ \rbrack\\}$.

Thus we can interpret the free monoid generated by $\emptyset$ as the _trivial
monoid_:

$$ \underline{1} := (\{e\}, e, \star) \ \text{ where } \ \star: \{e\} \times \{e\} \to \{e\}$$

where $e = \lbrack\ \rbrack$.
