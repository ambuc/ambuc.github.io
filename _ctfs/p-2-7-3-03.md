Given $\abs{A\times B} = \abs{A} \cdot \abs{B}$, if $A \times B = \emptyset$,
then $\abs{A \times B} = 0$. Thus it must be the case that either $\abs{A} = 0$
or $\abs{B} = 0$. Thus either $A = \emptyset$ or $B = \emptyset$. (There are no
sets with cardinality zero besides the empty set.) So the analogous statement
_is_ true of all sets.
