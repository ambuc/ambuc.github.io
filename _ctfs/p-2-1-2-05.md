> If $f: X \to Y$ is depicted with $x_1 \to y_1, x_2 \to y_2, x_3 \to y_4, x_4 \to
> y_1$, write its image, $\im{f}$ as a set.

Since 
$\im{f} := \\{y \in Y \mid \exists x \in X \text{ such that } f(x) = y\\}$, 
and since no element in $X$ maps to $y_5$, the image of $f$ is 
$\\{y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4\\}$.
