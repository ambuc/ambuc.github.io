> Let $P$ be the set of all people and let $\overline{I}$ be the set of all
> pieces of information known by the government. For each subset $I \subseteq
> \overline{I}$, let $K(I) \subseteq P$ be the set of people that need to know
> every piece of information in $I$. Let $S = \\{K(I) | I \subseteq
> \overline{I}\\}$ be the set of all "need-to-know groups", with the subset
> relation denoted $\leqslant$.
>
> _a)_ Is $(S, \leqslant)$ a preorder? If not, find a nearby preorder.
>
> _b)_ If $I_1 \subseteq I_2$ do we always have $K(I_1) \subseteq K(I_2)$ or
> $K(I_2) \subseteq K(I_1)$ or possibly neither?
>
> _c)_ Should the preorder $(S, \leqslant)$ have all meets?
>
> _d)_ Should $(S, \leqslant)$ have all joins?
