Let us define $f$ as subtraction mod 4 plus one, so that $f:M\times M\to M$.

$$ f(a,b) = ((a-b) \mod 4)+ 1$$

Here is a table of $f$ across $M\times M$:

      f| a=1  2  3  4
    ---+-------------
    b=1|   1  2  3  4
      2|   4  1  2  3
      3|   3  4  1  2
      4|   2  3  4  1 

We see that $f$ _is_ associative, as demonstrated (but not proven) below:

$$
\begin{align}
f(1,f(2,3)) &\stackrel{?}{=} f(f(1,2),3) \\
f(1,4) &\stackrel{?}{=} f(4,3) \\
2 = 2
\end{align}
$$

but no element of $M$ can serve as a unit for the monoid $f$ _would_ form:

 - $e=1$ cannot serve as a unit, since $\exists n=2$ s.t. $f(e,n) \neq n$. ($f(1,2) = 4 \neq 2$)
 - $e=2$ cannot serve as a unit, since $\exists n=3$ s.t. $f(e,n) \neq n$. ($f(2,3) = 4 \neq 3$)
 - $e=3$ cannot serve as a unit, since $\exists n=1$ s.t. $f(e,n) \neq n$. ($f(3,1) = 4 \neq 1$)
 - $e=4$ cannot serve as a unit, since $\exists n=4$ s.t. $f(e,n) \neq n$. ($f(4,4) = 1 \neq 4$)

Therefore no value in $M$ can serve as a unit for the monoid $f$ _would_ form;
thus $f$ cannot be the multiplication formula for a monoid on $M$.
