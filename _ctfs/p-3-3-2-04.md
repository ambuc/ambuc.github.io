There can be no identity element for a monoid formed from the concatenation of
paths in $\text{Path}\_G$. If there were, $p\pp \id = p = \id\pp p$ would hold
for any $p \in \text{Path}\_G$.
  
But take a degenerate graph $(\\{1\\},\emptyset,-,-)$ with one vertex and no
arrows. 

In this case $\text{Path}\_G := \\{\\{1\\}\\}$. If there were an element $\id$,
the path $p \pp \id$ would be of length two. But there are no elements in
$\text{Path}\_G$ of length two, so there is no identity element.
