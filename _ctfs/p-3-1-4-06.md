 - $f(n) = n^2$ fails to induce a monoid homomorphism, since $(a+b)^2 \neq
   a^2+b^2$ unless $a=0$ or $b=0$.
 - $f(n) = n-1$ fails to induce a monoid homomorphism, since $f(0) = -1 \neq
   0$.
 - $f(n) = n \mod{p}$ fails to induce a monoid homomorphism, since
   $$
   \begin{align}
   (a+b)\mod p &= ((a\mod p) + (b\mod p)) \mod p \\
               &\neq (a \mod p) + (b \mod p) \\
   f(a+b)      &\neq f(a) +' f(b)
   \end{align}
   $$

So any monoid homomorphism from $(\N,0,+)\to(\Z,0,+)$ needs to be centered
around zero and preserve linearity. This describes a linear transformation, and
the only linear transformations on natural numbers are described by $f(n) =
a\ast n$.
