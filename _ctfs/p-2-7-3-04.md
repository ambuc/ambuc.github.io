$\underline{5}^\underline{3} \times \underline{3} \to \underline{5}$ can be seen
as an evaluation:

 - $\underline{5}^\underline{3}$ is the set of all points in a
   $5\times5\times5$ grid. So $p \in \underline{5}^\underline{3}$ is a
   point in that grid.

 - $\underline{3} := \\{1,2,3\\}$. So $a \in \underline{3}$ is an axis in the
   set of all three axes.

So we can understand $\underline{5}^\underline{3} \times \underline{3}$ as an
evaluation function; given a single point in $\underline{5}^\underline{3}$ and a
single axis in $\underline{3}$, we can project the point on to that axis and
return a single element in $\underline{5}$ (a.k.a. how far along the axis that
point is).

So there is an obvious, canonical mapping between $\underline{5}^\underline{3}
\times \underline{3}$ and $\underline{5}$. 

But if that domain is flattened into a set of 375 points, that canonical mapping
is lost: an element in that domain no longer represents a point in a
three-dimensional grid paired with an axis in that grid; it merely represents
some point and some axis. So it is not obvious how to project that point, so
there is no canonical function $\underline{375} \to \underline{5}$.
