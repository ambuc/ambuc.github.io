Under the presented monoid model, let us define the set of relations as:

$$\{([a, BS], \lbrack\ \rbrack), ([b, BS], \lbrack\ \rbrack), ... ([z, BS],
\lbrack\ \rbrack)\}$$
 
> **b)** Under your relations, how does $[BS]$ compare with $\lbrack\ \rbrack$?
> Is that suitable?

Here, $[BS] \not\sim \lbrack\ \rbrack$, which is correct -- hitting the
backspace key should cancel the last letter key, and should not cancel an empty
list. In this case, the list $[BS]$ alone would not cancel anything.
