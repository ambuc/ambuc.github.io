If the graph $G$ has a path of length $n$ but also has multiple disconnected
components, there are multiple ways to map a chain graph $[n]$, depending on the
resolution of those disconnected components. 

Thus there is not a single canonical graph homomorphism $[n]\to G$ corresponding
to the path of length $n$ in question. 

Thus there is no isomorphism between the set of graph homomorphisms $[n]\to G$
and the set $\text{Path}^{(n)}\_G$ of length-$n$ paths in $G$.
