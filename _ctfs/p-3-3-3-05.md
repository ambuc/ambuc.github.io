> Let $G$ be a graph, let $n\in\N$ be a natural number, and let $\[n\]$ be the
> chain graph of length $n$, as in Example 3.3.1.8. Is a path of length $n$ in
> $G$ the same thing as a graph homomorphism $\[n\]\to G$, or are there subtle
> differences? More precisely, is there always an isomorphism between the set of
> graph homomorphisms $\[n\] \to G$ and the set $\text{Path}_G^{(n)}$ of
> length-$n$ paths in $G$?
