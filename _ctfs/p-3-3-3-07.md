Here are the diagrams in (3.6):

$$
\xymatrix {
  A \ar[r]^{f_1} \ar[d]_{\text{src}} & A'  \ar[d]^{\text{src'}} \\
  V \ar[r]_{f_0} & V'
}
\qquad
\xymatrix {
  A \ar[r]^{f_1} \ar[d]_{\text{tgt}} & A'  \ar[d]^{\text{tgt'}} \\
  V \ar[r]_{f_0} & V'
}
$$

Let us rewrite $i:A\to V\times V$ as $i(a) = (\text{src}(a), \text{tgt}(a))$,
and the equivalent for $i':A'\to V'\times V'$.

Let us evaluate $i' \circ f_1 = f_0 \times f_0 \circ i$ according to the first
diagram.

$$
\begin{align}
i' \circ f_1 &= f_0 \times f_0 \circ i \\
i' ( f_1 ( a ) ) &= (f_0 \times f_0) ( i ( a ) ) \\
(\text{src'}(f_1(a)), \text{tgt'}(f_1(a))) 
  &= (f_0 \times f_0)( \text{src}(a), \text{tgt}(a) ) \\
  &= (f_0(\text{src}(a)), f_0(\text{tgt}(a))) \\
\end{align}
$$

Now let us evaluate this intermediate expression according to the second two
diagrams.

$$
(\text{src'}(f_1(a)), \text{tgt'}(f_1(a))) 
 = (f_0(\text{src}(a)), f_0(\text{tgt}(a))) 
$$

Taking the first element of both sides, we find the commutative statement:

$$ \text{src'} \circ f_1 = f_0 \circ \text{src} $$

which is the same as the first diagram in (3.6).

Taking the second element of both sides, we find:

$$ \text{tgt'} \circ f_1 = f_0 \circ \text{tgt} $$

which is the same as the second diagram. Thus the two commutativities of the two
sets of diagrams are equivalent.
