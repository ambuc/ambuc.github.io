> Given a graph $(V, A, \text{src}, \text{tgt})$, let $i: A\to V\times V$ be a
> function guaranteed by the universal property for products, as applied to
> $\text{src}, \text{tgt}: A\to V$. One might hope to summarize Condition (3.6)
> for graph homomorphisms by the commutativity of the single square:

> $$
> \require{AMScd}
> \begin{CD}
> A         @>{f_1}>>            A'          \\
> @V{i}VV                        @VV{i'}V    \\
> V\times V @>>{f_0 \times f_0}> V'\times V'
> \end{CD}
> $$

> Is the commutativity of the diagram in (3.8) indeed equivalent to the
> commutativity of the diagrams in (3.6)?
