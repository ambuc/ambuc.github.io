> Find a set $A$ such that for any set $X$ there is an isomorphism of sets $X
> \cong \hbs(A, X)$.

The set $A = \\{1\\}$ satisfies this condition. In order for an isomorphism to
exist, there must be an obvious one-to-one mapping between elements. If there
is only one element in $A$, there are $\abs{X}$ mappings from $A \to X$, i.e. from
the element $1$ to each element $x \in X$. This means 
$\abs{X} = \abs{\hbs(A, X)}$.
