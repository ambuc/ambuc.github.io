> Let $M = \N$ be the set of natural numbers. Taking $e=1$, come up with a
> formula for $\star$ that gives $\N$ the structure of a monoid.

If $e=1$, multiplication ($\star(n,m) = nm$) gives $\N$ the structure of a
monoid. 

  - Identity laws hold: 
    - $e\star m = m\star e = m$
    - $1\times m = m\times 1 = m$.
  - Multiplication is associative: 
    - $(a\star b)\star c = a \star(b\star c)$
    - $(a b) c = a (b c)$.
