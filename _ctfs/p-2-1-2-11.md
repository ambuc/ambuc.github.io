An _isomorphism_ is a function which is invertible, i.e. a one-to-one
correspondence. For the first element in $X$, there are $\abs{X}$ choices; for the
second element, $\abs{X}-1$ choices, etc. Let us assign $n := \abs{X}$. So the total
number of choices is $n (n-1) (n-2) ... (1)$ $= \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = {n + 1
\choose 2}$.

> **b)** Does your formula from part _a)_ hold when $n=0$?

No, since ${0 \choose 2} = 0$ -- but there is one isomorphism, the set of no
arrows.
