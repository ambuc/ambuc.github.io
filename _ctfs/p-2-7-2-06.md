We can start with the definition of $\R^\underline{2}$: 

$$ \R^\underline{2} = \hbs(\underline{2}, \R) = \hbs(\{1,2\},\R) $$

Since we know we can define the set $\\{1,2\\} = \\{1\\} \sqcup \\{2\\}$, 
and since we
know $\hbs(X\sqcup Y, A) \cong \hbs(X,A) \times \hbs(Y, A)$ (2.4.2.10), we
can write:

$$ \R^\underline{2} \cong \hbs(\{1\}, \R) \times \hbs(\{2\}, \R)$$

Since $\\{1\\}\cong\\{2\\}$, and since $\hbs(\\{1\\},X) \cong X$ (2.1.2.14), 
we can write:

$$\R^\underline{2} \cong \R \times \R = \R^2$$
