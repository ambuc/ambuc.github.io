> Suppose that $\mathcal{S} := (S, \leqslant)$ is a preorder, and that $s_1, s_2
> \in S$ have join $t$ in $\mathcal{S}$. The preorder $\mathcal{S}^\text{op}$
> has the same elements as $\mathcal{S}$. Is $t$ the join of $s_1$ and $s_2$ in
> $\mathcal{S}^\text{op}$, or is it their meet, or is it not necessarily their
> meet nor their join.
