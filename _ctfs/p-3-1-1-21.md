Recall the definitions of $\sim_1$ and $\sim_2$ on a set of lists of length at
most 3:

$$[a_1, a_2, a_3, b] \sim_1 [a_1, a_2, b]$$

$$[a_1, a_2, a_3, b] \sim_2 [a_1, a_2, a_3]$$

From the definition of a _presented monoid_ (Definition 3.1.1.17), recall the
construction of the equivalence relation $\sim$ on a set of relations $\\{m_i,
m_i'\mid 1 \leq i \leq n\\}$:

$$ \sim\ := \{ (xm_i y \sim x m_i' y) \mid x,y\in\list(G), 1 \leq i \leq n \} $$

Thus equivalence persists across concatenation before and after the equivalent
phrases.

So, for $\sim_1$, we can write:

$$
\begin{align}
[a,b,c,d,e,f] &\sim_1 [a,b,c,d] \pp [e,f] \\
&\sim_1 [a,b,d] \pp [e,f] \\
&\sim_1 [a,b,d] \pp [e] \pp [f] \\
&\sim_1 [a,b,d,e] \pp [f] \\
&\sim_1 [a,b,e] \pp [f] \\
&\sim_1 [a,b,e,f] \\
&\sim_1 [a,b,f]
\end{align}
$$

And for $\sim_2$, we can write:

$$
\begin{align}
[a,b,c,d,e,f] &\sim_2 [a,b,c,d] \pp [e,f] \\
&\sim_2 [a,b,c] \pp [e,f] \\
&\sim_2 [a,b,c] \pp [e] \pp [f] \\
&\sim_2 [a,b,c,e] \pp [f] \\
&\sim_2 [a,b,c] \pp [f] \\
&\sim_2 [a,b,c,f] \\
&\sim_2 [a,b,c]
\end{align}
$$
