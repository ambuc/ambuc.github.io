> (Graphs to preorders).
>
> Recall from (2.3) that every function $f:A\to B$ has an image,
> $\text{im}\_f(A)\subseteq B$. Use this idea and Example 3.4.1.16 to construct
> a functor $\text{Im}:\textbf{Grph}\to\textbf{PrO}$ such that for any graph $G
> = (V,A,\text{src},\text{tgt})$ , the preorder has elements given by the
> vertices of $G$ (i.e. we have $\text{Im}(G) = (V, \leqslant\_G)$ for some
> ordering $\leqslant\_G$).
