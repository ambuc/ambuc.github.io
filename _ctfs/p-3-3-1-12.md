For $f, g : X \to Y$:

$$ \text{Eq}(f,g) := \{ x\in X \mid f(x) = g(x) \} $$

So $\text{Eq}(\text{src},\text{tgt}) $ represents the set of arrows $a\in A$
where $\text{src}(a) = \text{tgt}(a)$, i.e. the set of loop arrows.

> _b)_ What feature of a graph is captured by the coequalizer of its source and
> target functions?

For $f,g:X\to Y$:

$$ \text{Coeq}(f,g) := Y / f(x) \sim g(x) $$

So $\text{Coeq}(\text{src},\text{tgt})$ represents the quotient of $V$ by the
equivalence relation generated by $\\{(\text{src}(a), \text{tgt}(a)) \mid a \in
A\\} \subseteq V \times V$. This captures the notion of connected components in
a graph, and the cardinality of $V / \text{src}(a) \sim \text{tgt}(a)$ will be
the same as the number of connected components in the graph.
