The set of morphisms from $\underline{n}\to\emptyset$ is empty, since any such
morphism would need to map all the elements of $\underline{n}$ to some
element in $\emptyset$, which clearly holds no elements. So
$\abs{\hbs(\underline{n}, \emptyset)} = 0$, which means $0^\underline{n} = 0$.

By comparison, the set of morphisms from $\emptyset\to\emptyset$ need not be
empty. Any such morphism would have no domain and no codomain, and map no
elements. But there is one such morphism, an isomorphism between $\emptyset$ and
itself. So $\abs{\hbs(\emptyset, \emptyset)} = 1$, which means $0^0 = 1$.
