> For a finite set $A$, let $\abs{A} \in \N$ denote the cardinality of (number
> of elements in) $A$. If $A$ and $B$ are both finite (including the possibility
> that one or both are empty), is it always true that $\abs{B^A} =
> \abs{B}^\abs{A}$?

Recall that a function is a set of ordered pairs $\\{(a,b) | a\in A, b\in B\\}$,
where that set can be empty.

If $A$ and $B$ are non-empty, $\abs{B^A} = \abs{B}^\abs{A}$. 

If $A = \emptyset$:
 - $\abs{B}^\abs{A} = \abs{B}^0 = 1$.
 - $B^\emptyset = \hbs(\emptyset,B) = \\{\\{\\}\\}$, i.e. the set of functions
   has one element, an empty set of mappings $\emptyset\to B$. So
   $\abs{B^\emptyset} = 1$.

If $B = \emptyset$:
 - $\abs{B}^\abs{A} = 0^\abs{A} = 0$.
 - $\emptyset^A = \hbs(A, \emptyset) = \\{\\}$, i.e. the set of functions has
   no elements. So $\abs{\emptyset^A} = 0$.


So it is always true that $\abs{B^A} = \abs{B}^\abs{A}$.
