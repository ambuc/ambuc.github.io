> Sppose that $G = (V,A,\text{src},\text{tgt})$ and $G' = (V', A', \text{src}',
> \text{tgt}')$ are graphs and that $f = (f_0, f_1): G \to G'$ is a graph
> homomorphism (as in Definition 3.3.3.1).
>
> _a)_ If $f$ is an isomorphism in $\textbf{Grph}$, does this imply that
> $f_0:V\to V' and $f_1: A\to A'$ are isomorphisms in $\textbf{Set}$?
>
> _b)_ If so, why; and if not, show a counterexample (where $f$ is an
> isomorphism but either $f_0$ or $f_1$ is not).
