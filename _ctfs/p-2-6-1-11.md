> Suppose $N$ is a network (or graph). Let $X$ be the nodes of the network, and
> let $R \subseteq X\times X$ denote the relation such that $(x,y) \in R$ iff
> there exists an arrow connecting $x$ to $y$.
> 
> **a)** What is the equivalence relation $\sim$ generated by $R$?

$\sim$ represents the relation between connected nodes, i.e. which nodes are in
connected components with which other nodes. Each node is in a connected
component with itself (reflexivity), connections in an undirected graph are
two-way connections (symmetry), and two nodes which are connected to a third
node are connected to each other (transitivity).

> **b)** What is the quotient $X/\sim$?

The quotient of $X$ by $\sim$ ($X/\sim$) is the set of equivalence classes of
$\sim$; in this case, the set of connected components.
