> Show, in analogy to Proposition 2.7.5.5, that pushouts preserve epimorphisms.

An epimorphism is an arrow which, for all sets $B$ and pairs of functions $h,
h': Y\to B$, 

$$
\require{AMScd}
\begin{CD}
X @>{f}>> Y @>{h, h'}>> B
\end{CD}
$$

such that  $h\circ f = h' \circ f \implies h = h'$.

To show that pushouts preserve epimorphisms, we take sets $X$, $Y$, $W$, and
$Z$, where $Z$ is the pushout of $X$ and $Y$ over $W$.

$$
\require{AMScd}
\begin{CD}
W       @>{u}>>    Y            \\
@V{t}VV            @VV{i_2}V    \\
X       @>>{i_1}>  X \sqcup_W Y
\end{CD}
$$

We now take an arbitrary set $B$ and two maps $m,n: X\sqcup_W Y \to B$ such that
$m\circ i_2 = n\circ i_2$. Now let $q = m\circ i_1$ and $r = n\circ i_1$. The
diagram looks like this:

$$
\require{AMScd}
\begin{CD}
W       @>{u}>>              Y            \\
@V{t}VV                      @VV{i_2}V    \\
X       @>{i_1}>>            X \sqcup_W Y \\
@.     \diagdownarrow{r,\ q} @VV{m,n}V   \\
        @.                   B
\end{CD}
$$

We have that

$$ q \circ t = m \circ i_1 \circ t = m \circ i_2 \circ u = n \circ i_2 \circ u =
n \circ i_1 \circ t = r \circ t $$

$$ q \circ t = r \circ t \implies q = r$$

But we assumed that $t$ is an epimorphism so this implies that $q = r$. By the
universal property of pushouts, we have $m = n$.
