> **a)** Let $\\{1\\}$ denote a set with one element. What is the difference
> between sets over $\\{1\\}$ and simply sets?

To my eye, there is no difference. A set over $\\{1\\}$ is simply a pair
$(S,\pi)$ where $\pi(s) = 1\ \forall s\in S$. Thus there is an isomorphism
between any set $S$ and that set over $\\{1\\}$.
 
> **b)** Describe the sets relative to $\emptyset$. How many are there?

There is only one set relative to $\emptyset$, and that is $\emptyset$.

Any set $S$ relative to $\emptyset$ needs an associated mapping $\pi_S$ which
maps each element in $S$ to an element in $\emptyset$. But since there are no
such elements, there can be no such mappings. Thus the only valid definition of
$\pi$ is $\pi:\emptyset\to\emptyset$, which is a set of no mappings at all.
