> Let $S$ be the set of open subsets of earth as defined above. To each open
> subset of earth suppose we know the range of recorded temperature throughout
> $s$ (i.e. the low and high throughout the region). Thus to each element $s\in
> S$ we assign an interval $T(s) := \\{x\in\R \mid a \leqslant x \leqslant
> b\\}$. If we order the set $V$ of intervals of $\R$ by the subset relation, it
> gives a partial order on $V$.
>
> _a)_ Does our assignment $T:S\to V$ amount to a morphism of orders?
>
> _b)_ Does it preserve meets or joins? (Hint: it doesn't preserve both.)
