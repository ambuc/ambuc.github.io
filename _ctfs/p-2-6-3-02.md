> Let $X = \R$ be the set of real numbers. What is the coequalizer of the two
> maps $X \to X$ given by $x \mapsto x$ and $x \mapsto (x+1)$ respectively?

$\text{Coeq}(f,g) = \R$. Under the coequalizer, $f(x)\sim g(x) \implies f(1)\sim
g(1) \implies 1 \sim 2$, and $2\sim 3$, etc. Thus all the real numbers share a
single equivalence class under $X / f(x)\sim g(x)$.
