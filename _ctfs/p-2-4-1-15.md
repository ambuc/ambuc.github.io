The universal property for products guarantees the unique existence of
$\langle f, g \rangle : A \to X \times Y$ given some set $A$ with morphisms
$f$, $g$ to $X$, $Y$ respectively. 

What if $A := Y\times X$?
The morphisms $f$, $g$, become $f := \pi_2: Y\times X \to X$, 
$g := \pi_1: Y\times X \to Y$.

This guarantees us the induced morphism 
$\langle f, g \rangle : A \to X \times Y $
$= \langle \pi_2, \pi_1 \rangle : Y\times X \to X \times Y$, which is the swap
map.

> **b)** Can you prove that $s$ is an isomorphism using only the universal

Given the swap map $s: X\times Y \to Y\times X$ and its opposite 
$s': Y\times X \to X\times Y$ as defined above, 
$s' \circ s = \id_{X\times Y}$, $s\circ s' = \id_{Y\times X}$.

This defines an isomorphism $X\times Y \cong Y\times X$.
