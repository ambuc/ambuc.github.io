Since the definition of a relative set shows that 
 - the upper triangle commutes ($p = q\circ f$), and that
 - the lower triangle commutes ($q = r\circ g$), 

we can see that $p = r \circ g \circ f$.

Thus there is a reasonable notion of composition. A mapping of relative sets
over $(X,p)\to(Z,r)$ would be $g\circ f$.
