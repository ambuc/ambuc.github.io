> A relation on $\R$ is a subset of $\R\times\R$, and one can indicate such a
> subset of the plane by shading. Choose an error bound $\epsilon > 0$ and draw
> the relation one might refer to as "$\epsilon$-approximation". To say it
> another way, draw the relation "$x$ is within $\epsilon$ of $y$".
