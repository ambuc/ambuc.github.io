Sure, let us define the monoid over $S$ with $e = S$. 

 - The identity law holds, since, given an element $s \in \P(S)$, $s \cap S = s
   = S \cap s$.
 - The associative law holds, since the intersection operation is associative,
   i.e. $a \cap (b \cap c) = (a \cap b) \cap c$.

> element be? 

Sure, let us define the monoid over $S$ with $e = \emptyset$. 

 - The identity law holds, since, given an element $s \in \P(S)$, $s \cup
   \emptyset = s = \emptyset \cup s$. 
 - The associative law holds, since the union operation is associative, i.e. $a
   \cup (b \cup c) = (a \cup b) \cup c$.
