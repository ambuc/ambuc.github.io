> As mentioned in the introduciton to this section, the power set $S := \P(X)$
> of any set $X$ naturally has the structure of a partial order. Its elements
> $s\in S$ correspond to subsets $s \subseteq X$, and we put $s \leqslant t$ if
> and only if $s \subseteq t$ as subsets of $X$. The meet of two elements is
> their intersection as subsets of $X$, $s \wedge t = s \cap t$, and the join of
> two elements is their union as subsets of $X$, $s \vee t = s \cup t$.
>
> _a)_ Is it possible to put a monoid structure on the set $S$ in which the
> multiplication formula is given by meets? If so, what would the identity
> element be? 
>
> _b)_ Is it possible to put a monoid structure on the set $S$ in which the
> multiplication formula is given by joins? If so, what would the identity
> element be?
