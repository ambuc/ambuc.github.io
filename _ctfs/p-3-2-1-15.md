> Let $G$ be a group and $X$ a set on which $G$ acts by $\hookrightarrow:
> G\times X \to X$. Is "being in the same orbit" an equivalence relation on $X$?

Yes, "being in the same orbit" is an equivalence relation. We can take "$x$ and
$y$ are in the same orbit" as $x \sim y$, or $(x,y)$.

In order for $\sim$ to be an equivalence relation, we must prove:

   - $x\sim x$ (reflexivity),
     - The orbit of $x$ in a group $G$ is defined as $Gx := \\{x'\in X \mid
       \exists g\in G \text{ such that } gx=x'\\}$.
     - Let us take $g \in G$ where $g = e$; thus $gx = ex = x$, so $x$ is in its
       own orbit $Gx$.
     - Thus $x \sim x$.
   - $x\sim y$ implies $y\sim x$ (symmetry),
     - Let $g\in G$ exist such that $gx = y$.
     - Every element in $G$ has an inverse such that $g(g'(x)) = e(x) = x$. 
     - So $g'(g(x)) = g'(y)$, and $g'(g(x)) = x$.
     - So there is an action $g'$ which maps $y \mapsto x$.
     - So if $y$ is in $x$'s orbit, $x$ is also in $y$'s orbit.
     - Thus $x\sim y$ imples $y\sim x$.
   - $x\sim y$ and $y\sim z$ implies $x\sim z$ (transitivity).
     - Orbits are transitive; any two group actions can be composed into another
       group action.
     - Thus if $y$ is in $x$'s orbit, the orbit $Gx = Gy$.
     - So $Gx = Gy = Gz$, so "being in the same orbit" is transitive.

Thus "being in the same orbit" is an equivalence relation, and that orbit
partitions $X$.
