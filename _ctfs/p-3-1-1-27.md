Under my scheme, a cyclic monoid has a head and a body, each with a length. So a
cyclic monoid can be named an $n,m$-cyclic monoid, where $n$ is the length of
the head and $m$ is the length of the body.

For example, the cyclic monoid with generator $Q$ and relation $Q^7 = Q^4$,
which is drawn:

$$
\require{AMScd}
\begin{CD}
e @>>> Q @>>> Q_1 @>>> Q_2 @>>> Q_3 @>>>           Q_4  \\
@.     @.     @.       @.       @.  \diaguparrow{} @VVV \\
@.     @.     @.       @.       Q_6 @<<<           Q_5
\end{CD}
$$

Has $n = 5$, $m=3$. So it could be named a $5,3$-cyclic monoid.
