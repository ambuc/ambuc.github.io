$\hbs(X, Y)$ is the set of functions $X \to Y$. For any function 
$X \to Y$, each element $x \in X$ must be mapped to an element in $Y$, of 
which there are $\abs{Y}$ choices. So the cardinality 
$\abs{\hbs(X,Y)} = \abs{Y}^\abs{X}$. So 
$\abs{\hbs(A,B)} = \abs{B}^\abs{A} = 2^5 = 32$.

> **b)** How many elements does $\hbs(B, A)$ have?

&zwj;
$\abs{\hbs(B,A)} = \abs{A}^\abs{B} = 5^2 = 25$.
