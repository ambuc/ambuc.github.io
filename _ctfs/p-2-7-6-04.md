If $\pi$ neeed not be surjective, then elements $e\in E$ can have multiplicity
0; that is, $\abs{\pi^{-1}(b)} = 0$ for some $b\in B$. 

This means we can define a pseudo-multiset _on_ another (larger, well-known)
set, and inherit a default multiplicity of zero for all elements.

A pseudo-multiset might be $X := (E, B, \pi)$ where $E = \\{1_1, 1_2\\}$, $B =
\Z$, and $\pi(1) = 2$. 

We can see that the naming function $\pi$ is not defined on any other values in
$\Z$. Since it is not the case that each element in $\Z$ has a mapping from
$E$, $\pi$ is _not_ surjective, and $X$ is a psuedo-multiset but not a
multi-set.

A pseudo-multiset can have elements with multiplicity zero.

A pseudo-multiset is more useful, since it can be defined _on_ or _over_ a set.
