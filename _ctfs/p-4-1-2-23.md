> _a)_ Consider the graph $G$ from Example 3.3.3.3. Draw the paths-graph
> $\text{Paths}(G)$ for $G$.
>
> _b)_ Repeating the above exercise for $G'$ from the same example would be
> hard, because the path graph $\text{Paths}(G')$ has infinitely many arrows.
> However, the graph homomorphism $f: G\to G'$ does induce a morphism of
> paths-graps $\text{Paths}(f): \text{Paths}(G)\to\text{Paths}(G')$, and it is
> possible to say how that acts on the vertices and arrows of
> $\text{Paths}(G')$. Please do so.
>
> _c)_ Given a graph homomorphism $f:G\to G'$ and two paths $p:v\to w$ and $q:
> w\to x$ in $G$, is it true that $\text{Paths}(f)$ preserves the concatenation?
> What does that even mean?
