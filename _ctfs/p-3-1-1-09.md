 - A set ($\underline 1$) with one element $\\{e\\}$ can be given the structure of a monoid, but that monoid is commutative: with one element, $mn=nm\ \forall m,n\in \\{e\\}$.

 - A set ($\underline 2$) with two elements $\\{e,a\\}$ can be given the structure of a monoid,
   but in order for $\star$ to be a valid multiplication function, it must be
   true that $e\star a = a = a\star e$, in which case the monoid is commutative.

 - A set ($\underline 3$) with three elements $\\{e,a,b\\}$ can be given the structure of a monoid, where $\star$ is a valid multiplication function which preserves identity and is associative, but not commutative:

        i * j | i=e  a  b
       -------+------------
         j=e  |   e  a  b
           a  |   a  a  a
           b  |   b  b  b

   We can see that the multiplication function $\star$ is still associative:
   $\star$ takes the latter of two arguments, unless one of those arguments is
   $e$:
   
   $$(i\star j)\star k = i\star(j\star k) \ \forall i,j,k\in M$$

   But $\star$ is not commutative:

   $$a\star b = b \neq a = b \star a$$

So the smallest set $M$ which can be given the structure of a non-commutative
monoid has cardinality 3.
 
> **b)** What is the smallest set $M$ that you can give the structure of a
> monoid?

As seen above, there is a monoid $M = (\\{e\\},e,\star)$ with cardinality one.
