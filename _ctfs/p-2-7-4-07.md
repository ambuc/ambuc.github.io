$\Delta^2$ has 
 - $X_0 = \\{1,2,3\\}$, 
 - $X_1 = \\{\\{1,2\\},\\{2,3\\},\\{3,1\\}\\}$, 
 - $X_2 = \\{\\{1,2,3\\}\\}$, 
 - $X_3 = X_4 = X_5 ... = \emptyset$.

$\Delta^2$ could be rendered as a triangle with three edges between three
points. It is filled-in, since it contains one face in $X_2$.

But $X  = \partial\Delta^2$ has
 - $X_0 = \\{1,2,3\\}$,
 - $X_1 = X_2 = X_3 ... = \emptyset$.

$\partial\Delta^2$ could be rendered as three points. There are no edges and no
faces.
