If $B$ is a set, $\text{List}(B) := (B, e, \star)$ is a free monoid on $B$.
Let us define $e = \lbrack\ \rbrack$ as the empty list of actions, (i.e.
pressing no buttons) and $\star$ as the composition of buttons, i.e. pressing
one after another.

If $G'$ is a game where the state changes over time without controller input
(such as Snake), then $\text{List}(B)$ could not be said to act on the states of
$G'$, sicnce $e \cdot s \neq s$. (Recall that $e \cdot s = s$ is the identity
law of a monoid action.)

If $G$ is a game where $\text{List}(B)$ _could_ be said to act on the states of
$G$, then 
 - (a) the game cannot advance by itself, and 
 - (b) the state needs to be a "pure" method on the input.

   (For example, if the controller inputs $l,r\in B$ cancel out, as in a
   presented monoid with relations $([l,r], [])$ and $([r,l], [])$, then it _has
   to be the case_ that $l \cdot (r \cdot s) = (l \star r) \cdot s = \lbrack\
   \rbrack \cdot s = s$.

   That is: for any state in the game, pressing left and then right must
   return you that state.

Sure -- for some computer games, the keys $\texttt{w}, \texttt{a}, \texttt{s},
\texttt{d}$ map to $\uparrow, \leftarrow, \downarrow, \rightarrow$. In this
case, for a pair like $(\texttt{w},\uparrow)$, it is always the case that
$\texttt{w}\circ s =\ \uparrow\circ s$.

An element $b$ which serves as the identity element of the free monoid
$\text{List}(B)$ could be called a no-op, which is short for no-operation.

If no input sequence $\ell \in \text{List}(B)$ affects the state of the game,
you might be considered "dead".
