> Let $B$ denote the set of buttons (or positions) of a video game controller
> (other than, say 'start' and 'select'), and consider the free monoid
> $\text{List}(B)$ on $B$.
> 
> **a)** What would it mean for $\text{List}(B)$ to act on the set of states of
> some game? Imagine a video game $G'$ that uses the controller, but for which
> $\text{List}(B)$ would not be said to act on the states of $G'$. Now imagine a
> simple game $G$ for which $\text{List}(B)$ would be said to act.
>
> **b)** Can you think of a state $s$ of $G$, and two distinct elements $\ell,
> \ell' \in \text{List}(B)$ such that $\ell \circlearrowright s = \ell'
> \circlearrowright s$ ? In video game parlance, what would you call an element
> $b\in B$ such that, for every state $s \in G$, one has $b \circlearrowright s
> = s$?
>
> **c)** In video game parlance, what would you call a state $s \in S$ such
> that, for every sequence of buttons $\ell \in \text{List}(B)$, one has $\ell
> \circlearrowright s = s$?
