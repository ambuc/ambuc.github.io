> **a)** How many elements does $\P(\emptyset)$ have?

$\abs{\P(\emptyset)} = 1$. There is one subset of the empty set, itself.

> **b)** How many elements does $\P(\\{1\\})$ have?

$\abs{\P(\\{1\\})} = 2$. There are two subsets of $\\{1\\}$: itself and
$\emptyset$.
 
> **c)** How many elements does $\P(\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\})$ have?

$\abs{\P(\\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\})} = 32$. I won't enumerate them, but for any subset
$S' \subseteq S$, an element $s \in S$ either _is_ or _is not_ included in $S'$.
With two choices per element, there are $2^6$ possible subsets in a set with 6
elements.
 
> **d)** Any idea why they may have named it "power set"?

Because $\abs{\P(\underline{n})} = 2^n$; two to the nth power.
