> Take a set $I$ of sets, i.e. suppose that for each element $i\in I$ you are

 - A set $X_i \cong X_i$, so $\sim$ is reflexive.
 - $X_i \cong X_j \implies X_j \cong X_i$, so $\sim$ is symmetric.
 - And $X_i \cong X_j \text{ and } X_j \cong X_k \implies X_i \cong X_k$, since
   isomorphism between sets is transitive. 

So $\sim$ is an equivalence relation on $I$.
