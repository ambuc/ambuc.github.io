> Consider the functor $\text{Im}: \textbf{Grph}\to\textbf{PrO}$ constructed in
> Exercise 4.1.2.11.
>
> _a)_ Is every preorder $\mathcal{X} \in \text{Ob}(\textbf{PrO})$ in the image
> of $\text{Im}$ (or more precisely in the image of
> $\text{Ob}(\text{Im}):\text{Ob}(\textbf{Grph})\to\text{Ob}(\textbf{PrO})$)?
>
> _b)_ If so, why; if not, name a preorder not in the image.
>
> _c)_ Suppose that $\mathcal{X},\mathcal{Y}\in\text{Ob}(\textbf{PrO})$ are two
> preorders that are in the image of $\text{Im}$. Is every preorder morphism
> $f:\mathcal{X}\to\mathcal{Y}$ in the image of $\text{Hom}\_\text{Im}$? In
> other words, does every preorder homomorphism between $\mathcal{X}$ and
> $\mathcal{Y}$ come from a graph homomorphism?
