> **a)** Draw the relation $\\{(x,y)\mid y=x^2\\}$.

This is the line $y = x^2$ in the real plane.

> **b)** Draw the relation $\\{(x,y)\mid y \geqslant x^2\\}$.

This is the shaded part of the plane above and containing the line $y = x^2$.

> **c)** Let $S_0$ be the equivalence relation on $\R$ generated (in the sense
> of Lemma 2.6.1.7) by the empty set. Draw $S$ as a subset of the plane.

The set $\emptyset$ generates the equivalence relation $S_0 = \\{(x,x)\mid x\in
\R\\}$. 

By definition, $S_0$ need only contain $\emptyset$ and obey reflexivity,
symmetry, and transitivity. To obey reflexivity, it must contain $\\{(x,x)\mid
x\in\R\\}$. If it contains $\\{(x,x)\mid x\in\R\\}$, then it is automatically
symmetric and transitive.

> **d)** Consider the equivalence relation $S_1$ generated by $\\{(1,2),(1,3)\\}$.
> Draw $S_1$ in the plane. Highlight the equivalence class containing $(1,2)$.

The set $\\{(1,2),(1,3)\\}$ generates the equivalence relation $S_1 :=
\\{(x,y)\mid x,y\in\\{1,2,3\\}\\} \cup \\{(x,x) \mid x\in\R\\}$.

By definition, $S_1$ need only contain $\\{(1,2),(1,3)\\}$ and obey reflexivity,
symmetry, and transitivity. To obey reflexivity, it must include $\\{(x,x)\mid
x\in\R\\}$. To obey symmetry, it must also include $\\{(2,1),(3,1)\\}$. To
ensure that $S_1$ obeys transitivity, we observe that it includes $(3,1)$ and
$(1,2)$ and must therefore also include $(3,2)$, and also $(2,3)$.

> **e)** The reflexivity property and the symmetry property have pleasing
> visualizations in $\R\times\R$; what are they?

Reflexivity means that the set $\\{(x,x)\mid x\in\R\\}$ will be included in all
equivalence relations.

Symmetry means that for any point $(x,y)$, an equivalence relation containing
it must also contain $(y,x)$. This is equivalent to reflecting that point across
the line $y=x$.

> **f)** Is there a nice heuristic for visualizing the transitivity property?

Transitivity means that for any two points $(x,y)$, $(y,z)$, an equivalence
relation containing both must also contain $(x,z)$. This amounts to $(x,y)$ and
$(y,z)$ defining opposite corners of a rectangle, and the existence of that
rectangle necessitates that the other two corners $(x,z)$ and $(y,y)$ must also
be in the equivalence relation. (As well as the necessary symmetries $(y,x)$,
$(z,y)$, and $(z,x)$ and the transitive points they include, etc.)
