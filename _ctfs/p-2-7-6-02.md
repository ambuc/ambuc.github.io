> **a)** Come up with some notion of mapping for multisets that generalizes
> functions when the notion is restricted to sets.

A multiset $\mathcal{X}$ is defined as a set $X$ and an associated multiplicity
function $\mu_X:X\to\N_{\geq1}$ which maps each element $x\in X$ to a
non-negative integer, i.e. how many times it appears in $\mathcal{X}$.

Just as a disjoint union 'labels' elements with their origins, our local notion
of a multiset can 'label' an element with its index. Thus a multiset
$\mathcal{X} = (1,1,2,3)$ could be written as a set $X = (1_1, 1_2, 2_1, 3_1)$.

Now a notion of mapping for multisets can be expressed as mapping for sets. 

Let us define an isomorphic flattening function
$f:\textbf{MSet}\to\textbf{Set}$, which maps a multiset in the category of
multisets to its 'flattened' set in the category of sets.

Given two multisets $\mathcal{X} = \langle X, \mu_X \rangle$ and $\mathcal{Y} =
\langle Y, \mu_Y \rangle$, and a flattened mapping $p: X\to Y$, we could express
the unflattened mapping $p':\mathcal{X}\to\mathcal{Y}$ as $p' = f^{-1} \circ p
\circ f$.

Under this notion, given a multiset
$\mathcal{M} := \langle M, \mu_M \rangle$, the cardinality of that multiset is
$\abs{\mathcal{M}} = \sum_{e\in M} \mu_M(e)$.

So $\abs{\mathcal{X}} = \abs{\mathcal{Y}} = 4$. 
So $\hbs(\mathcal{X}, \mathcal{Y}) = 4^4 = 256$.
