> Find a universal property enjoyed by the coequalizer of two arrows.

Since the coequalizer is the dual of the equalizer, the universal property
enjoyed by the coequalizer (if present) of two arrows:

$$
\require{AMScd}
\begin{CD}
X @>{f}>{g}> Y @>{q}>> Q \\
@. @. \diagdownarrow{q'} @V{u}VV \\
@. @. Q'
\end{CD}
$$

commutes such that $q\circ f = q' \circ g$.
