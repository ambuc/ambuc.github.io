> Let $W := \N = \\{0,1,2,...\\}$ denote the set of natural numbers, let $X =
> \Z$ denote the set of integers, and let $Y = \\{1\\}$ denote a one-element
> set.  Define $f:W\to X$ by $f(w) = -(w+1)$, and define $g: W\to Y$ to be the
> unique map. Describe the set $X \sqcup_W Y$.

\require{AMScd}
\begin{CD}
W := \N @>{f(w) = -(w+1)}>> X := \Z \\
@V{g}VV @V{i_1}VV \\
Y := \{1\} @>{i_2}>> X \sqcup_W Y
\end{CD}
$$

The fiber sum $X\sqcup_W Y$ is the quotient of $X\sqcup W\sqcup Y / \sim$, which
divides the disjoint union of $X$, $W$, and $Y$ into equivalence classes. Since
$g:W\to Y$ equates all natural numbers in $W$ into one equivalence class, any
pushout $Z \stackrel{\cong}{\to} X \sqcup_W Y$ will have a single element.
