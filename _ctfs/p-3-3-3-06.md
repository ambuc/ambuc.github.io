> Given a morphism of graphs $f: G \to G'$, there is an induced function
> $\text{Path}(f): \text{Path}(G) \to \text{Path}(G')$.
>
> _a)_: Is it the case that for every $n\in\N$, the function $\text{Path}(f)$
> carries $\text{Path}^{(n)}(G)$ to $\text{Path}^{(n)}(G')$, or can path
> lengths change in this process?
>
> _b)_: Suppose that $f_0$ and $f_1$ are injective (meaning no two distinct
> vertices in $G$ are sent to the same vertex (respectively for arrows) under
> $f$). Does this imply that $\text{Path}(f)$ is also injective (meaning no two
> distinct paths are sent to the same path under $f$)?
>
> _c)_: Suppose that $f_0$ and $f_1$ are surjective (meaning every vertex in
> $G'$ and every arrow in $G'$ is in the image of $f$). Does this imply that
> $\text{Path}(f)$ is also surjective? 
>
> Hint: at least one of the answers to these three questions is "no".
