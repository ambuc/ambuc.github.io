Even if two elements $g_1, g_2 \in G$ map to the same $g' \in G'$, the arrow
$g_1 \mapsto g_2$ will have an equivalent self-arrow $g' \mapsto g'$ in $G'$; so
path lengths need not change.

Let us assume $\text{Path}(f)$ is not injective. 

There could then be two paths $p_1, p_2 \in \text{Path}(G)$ and a path $p' \in
\text{Path}(G')$ such that $\text{Path}(f)(p_1) = \text{Path}(f)(p_2) = p'$.

Let us assume $p' = v'\_0 a'\_0 v'\_1 a'\_1 ... v'\_{n-1} a'\_{n-1} v'\_n$.

Since $f_0 : V\to V'$ and $f_1: A\to A'$ are injective, there is a uniquely
defined vertex and arrow for each element in path $p'$; the concatenation of
these uniquely defined vertices is $p = v\_0 a\_0 ... v'\_n$. 

Thus $p_1 = p_2$, which makes $\text{Path}(f)$ injective as well.

No. Take the graph from (3.7):

$$
\xymatrix{
 \bullet^1 \ar[r]^a \ar@/^/[d]^d \ar@/_/[d]_c &\bullet^2 \ar[r]^b &\bullet^3 \\
 \bullet^4 &\bullet^5 \ar[r]^e &\bullet^6
}
\qquad
\to
\qquad
\xymatrix {
  \bullet^{1'} \ar[r]^w \ar[d]^y &\bullet^{2'} \ar@<1ex>[l]^x \\
  \bullet^{4'}  &\bullet^{5'} \ar@(ur,dr)[]^z
}
$$

In $G'$, it is possible to construct the path $[1', w, 2', x, 1', y, 4']$. But
there is no equivalent map in $G$.

A graph homomorphism can be seen as "collapsing" two points (here, $1$ and $3$)
to meet at the same point (here, $1'$). This creates the illusion that any path
$[1',y,4']$ in $G'$ can be traversed from its image in $G$. But this is not
true, as there is no path from _every_ image of $1'$ to the image of $4'$. In
particular, there is no path from $3$ to $4$ in $G$.
