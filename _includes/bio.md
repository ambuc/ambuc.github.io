I'm a senior in [Mechanical Engineering](http://mechanical.illinois.edu/) at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](http://illinois.edu/), with a focus in Computational Mechanics and Numerical Methods.

This past year, I studied Sustainability Engineering and Technology at [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](https://www.kth.se/) in Stockholm, [Sweden](http://sweden.jbuckland.com).

In the past, I've seen employment as:

 - a web programmer at the [Cognitive Computation Group](http://cogcomp.cs.illinois.edu/),
 - a research assistant with the [Continuous Casting Consortium](http://ccc.illinois.edu/), 
 - an astrophysics intern at the [American Museum of Natural History](http://www.amnh.org/), and
 - a computer technician at the [Hayden Planetarium](http://www.amnh.org/our-research/hayden-planetarium).
