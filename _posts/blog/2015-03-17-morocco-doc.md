This is a report Alexandre Oudet, Jean-Fraņcois Olivier, Heinrich Boeing,
Akshaya Kumar, and I compiled in March 2015, as part of the _MJ2412 Renewable
Energy Technology_ course at _KTH_, in Stockholm. We designed and evaluated the
feasibility and necessary physical and mechanical constraints on a number of
potential technologies involved in the construction and operation of a solar
field. Physical models were developed in conjunction with financial data, to
estimate the potential supply and forecasted demand in the region. An iterative
method was used to calculate all relevant power plant variables to some optimal
efficiency.

We choose the parabolic trough in order to meet our base-load capacity
requirement of 100 MWe. In a parabolic trough, sunlight is concentrated towards
a receiver carrying a heat transfer fluid. With water as the transfer fluid,
steam is directly generated for use in a power plant. However, the stability of
a water-based receiver is uncertain, and steam-based heat storage is complex. We
thus propose the use of an oil-based fluid for heat transfer. These oils are
single-phase fluids with an efficient heat transfer coefficient, and a
temperature range fitting our needs, as well as the possibility for direct
storage. Synthetic oils are preferred over mineral oils for their lesser
flammability. We will employ this working fluid in a thermodynamic Rankine
cycle, detailed in Section 4.
