This pset works through [_Category Theory for Scientists_][1], covering [Chapter 1][2]â€“[Chapter 2.2][3] and all exercises in sections 2.1, 2.2. 

You can follow along with the [textbook][4] at home.

All solutions are my own; feel free to [email me](james.adam.buckland@gmail.com) with corrections.

# 2.1.1.2
> Let $A = {1,2,3}$. What are all the subsets of $A$? Hint: there are 8.  

Any element $a$ either _is_ or _is not_ included in a subset $A' \in A$. With
two choices per element, there are $2^\abs{A} = 2^3 = 8$ possible subsets.

# 2.1.2.5

> If $f: X \to Y$ is depicted with $x_1 \to y_1, x_2 \to y_2, x_3 \to y_4, x_4 \to
> y_1$, write its image, $\im{f}$ as a set.

Since 
$\im{f} := \\{y \in Y \mid \exists x \in X \text{ such that } f(x) = y\\}$, 
and since no element in $X$ maps to $y_5$, the image of $f$ is 
$\\{y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4\\}$.

# 2.1.2.6

> Let $A = \\{1,2,3,4,5\\}$ and $B = \\{x,y\\}$. 
>
> **a)** How many elements does $\hbs(A, B)$ have? 

$\hbs(X, Y)$ is the set of functions $X \to Y$. For any function 
$X \to Y$, each element $x \in X$ must be mapped to an element in $Y$, of 
which there are $\abs{Y}$ choices. So the cardinality 
$\abs{\hbs(X,Y)} = \abs{Y}^\abs{X}$. So 
$\abs{\hbs(A,B)} = \abs{B}^\abs{A} = 2^5 = 32$.

> **b)** How many elements does $\hbs(B, A)$ have?

&zwj;
$\abs{\hbs(B,A)} = \abs{A}^\abs{B} = 5^2 = 25$.

<hr/>

# 2.1.2.7
> **a)** Find a set $A$ such that for all sets $X$ there is exactly one element
> in $\hbs(X, A)$.

The set $A = \\{1\\}$ satisfies this condition. 
$\abs{\hbs(X, A)} = \abs{A}^\abs{X} = 1^x = 1$.

> **b)** Find a set $B$ such that for all sets $X$ there is exactly one element
> in $\hbs(B, X)$.

The set $B = \emptyset$.

Observe $\abs{\hbs(B,X)} = \abs{X}^\abs{B} = \abs{X}^0 = 1$.
There is only one way to map the empty set; an empty mapping with no arrows
at all.

# 2.1.2.11

> Let $n \in \N$ be a natural number and let $X$ be a set with exactly $n$
> elements.
>
> **a)** How many isomorphisms are there from $X$ to itself?

An _isomorphism_ is a function which is invertible, i.e. a one-to-one
correspondence. For the first element in $X$, there are $\abs{X}$ choices; for the
second element, $\abs{X}-1$ choices, etc. Let us assign $n := \abs{X}$. So the total
number of choices is $n (n-1) (n-2) ... (1)$ $= \frac{n(n+1)}{2} = {n + 1
\choose 2}$.

> **b)** Does your formula from part _a)_ hold when $n=0$?

No, since ${0 \choose 2} = 0$ -- but there is one isomorphism, the set of no
arrows.

# 2.1.2.14

> Find a set $A$ such that for any set $X$ there is an isomorphism of sets $X
> \cong \hbs(A, X)$.

The set $A = \\{1\\}$ satisfies this condition. In order for an isomorphism to
exist, there must be an obvious one-to-one mapping between elements. If there
is only one element in $A$, there are $\abs{X}$ mappings from $A \to X$, i.e. from
the element $1$ to each element $x \in X$. This means 
$\abs{X} = \abs{\hbs(A, X)}$.

# 2.1.2.15

> **a)** Let $A = \\{a,b,c,d\\}$. If $f: \underline{10} \to A$ is given by
> $(a,b,c,c,b,a,d,d,a,b)$, what is $f(4)$?

Since $\underline{n} := \\{1,2,3...n\\}$, where $f(n)$ is the $n$th element
in the sequence given by $f$, $f(4) = c$.

> **b)** Let $s: \underline{7} \to \N$ be given by $s(i) = i^2$. Write $s$ out
> as a sequence.

$s: \underline{7} \to \N = (1^2, 2^2, 3^2, 4^2, 5^2, 6^2, 7^2)$
$= (1,4,9,16,25,36,49)$.

<hr/>

# 2.1.2.17
> Let $A = \\{5,6,7\\}$. 
>
> **a)** What is $\abs{A}$?

$\abs{A} = 3$.

> **b)** What is $\abs{\N}$?

$\abs{\N} := \aleph_0$.

> What is $\abs{\\{n \in \N \mid n \leqslant 5\\}}$ ?

$\abs{\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}} = 5$ .
