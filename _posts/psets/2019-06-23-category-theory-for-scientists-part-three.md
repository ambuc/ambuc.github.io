# 2.6.1.3

> Let $X$ be the set of people on earth; define a binary relation $R \subseteq X
> \times X$  on $X$ as follows. For a pair $(x,y)$ of people, say $(x,y) \in R$
> if $x$ spends a lot of time thinking about $y$. Is this relation reflexive?

$R$ is not reflexive, since it is not the case that a person necessarily spends
a lot of time thinking about themselves. $R$ is not symmetric, since it is
possible for $x$ to think about $y$ without $y$ thinking about $x$. And $R$ is
not transitive, since it is possible for there to be a person $x$ who doesn't
think about a person $z$ but does think about a person $y$, who thinks about
$z$.

# 2.6.1.5 

> Let $X$ and $B$ be sets and let $f: X\to B$ be a function. Define a subset $R
> \subseteq X \times X$ by $R = \\{(x,y) \mid f(x) = f(y)\\}$.
>
> **a)** Is $R$ an equivalence relation?

$R$ is the equality operation on elements of $x$; equality is:
 - reflexive: $x = x \quad\forall x \in X$, 
 - symmetric: $x = y \implies y = x \quad\forall x,y\in X$, and 
 - transitive: $x = y \text{ and } y = z \implies x = z \quad\forall x,y,z\in
   X$.

So $R$ is an equivalence relation.  

> **b)** Are all equivalence relations on $X$ obtainable in this way (as the
> fibers of some function having domain $X$)?  **c)** Does this viewpoint on

Surely all equivalence _classes_ on $X$ are obtainable as the partition of a set
$X$; a partition can be seen as a function $X\to I$, where $I$ is the set of all
equivalence classes on $X$. (i.e. a partition $p(x) \mapsto i, x\in X, i\in I$.)

Since an equivalence relation is an instance of an equivalence class which obeys
some properties, all equivalence relations are obtainable in this way.

 - A set $X_i \cong X_i$, so $\sim$ is reflexive.
 - $X_i \cong X_j \implies X_j \cong X_i$, so $\sim$ is symmetric.
 - And $X_i \cong X_j \text{ and } X_j \cong X_k \implies X_i \cong X_k$, since
   isomorphism between sets is transitive. 

So $\sim$ is an equivalence relation on $I$.

This is the line $y = x^2$ in the real plane.

> **b)** Draw the relation $\\{(x,y)\mid y \geqslant x^2\\}$.

This is the shaded part of the plane above and containing the line $y = x^2$.

> **c)** Let $S_0$ be the equivalence relation on $\R$ generated (in the sense

The set $\emptyset$ generates the equivalence relation $S_0 = \\{(x,x)\mid x\in
\R\\}$. 

By definition, $S_0$ need only contain $\emptyset$ and obey reflexivity,
symmetry, and transitivity. To obey reflexivity, it must contain $\\{(x,x)\mid
x\in\R\\}$. If it contains $\\{(x,x)\mid x\in\R\\}$, then it is automatically
symmetric and transitive.

> **d)** Consider the equivalence relation $S_1$ generated by $\\{(1,2),(1,3)\\}$.
> Draw $S_1$ in the plane. Highlight the equivalence class containing $(1,2)$.

The set $\\{(1,2),(1,3)\\}$ generates the equivalence relation $S_1 :=
\\{(x,y)\mid x,y\in\\{1,2,3\\}\\} \cup \\{(x,x) \mid x\in\R\\}$.

By definition, $S_1$ need only contain $\\{(1,2),(1,3)\\}$ and obey reflexivity,
symmetry, and transitivity. To obey reflexivity, it must include $\\{(x,x)\mid
x\in\R\\}$. To obey symmetry, it must also include $\\{(2,1),(3,1)\\}$. To
ensure that $S_1$ obeys transitivity, we observe that it includes $(3,1)$ and
$(1,2)$ and must therefore also include $(3,2)$, and also $(2,3)$.

> **e)** The reflexivity property and the symmetry property have pleasing
> visualizations in $\R\times\R$; what are they?

Reflexivity means that the set $\\{(x,x)\mid x\in\R\\}$ will be included in all
equivalence relations.

Symmetry means that for any point $(x,y)$, an equivalence relation containing
it must also contain $(y,x)$. This is equivalent to reflecting that point across
the line $y=x$.

> **f)** Is there a nice heuristic for visualizing the transitivity property?

Transitivity means that for any two points $(x,y)$, $(y,z)$, an equivalence
relation containing both must also contain $(x,z)$. This amounts to $(x,y)$ and
$(y,z)$ defining opposite corners of a rectangle, and the existence of that
rectangle necessitates that the other two corners $(x,z)$ and $(y,y)$ must also
be in the equivalence relation. (As well as the necessary symmetries $(y,x)$,
$(z,y)$, and $(z,x)$ and the transitive points they include, etc.)

> Consider the binary relation $R = \\{(n, n+1) \mid n \in \Z\\} \subseteq \Z
> \times \Z$.
> 
> **a)** What is the equivalence relation generated by $R$?

$R=\\{(n,n+1)\mid n\in\Z\\}$ generates the equivalence relation $S_R$ which 
covers the whole plane $\Z\times\Z$. Since $S_R$ is an equivalence relation, for
any $x\in\Z$, $(x,x)\in S_R$. But since $S_R$ contains $R$, $S_R$ also contains
$(x, x+1)$. Finally, since $S_R$ contains $(x, x+1)$ and $(x+1, x+2)$, $S_R$
also contains $(x, x+2)$ and so on and so forth.
 
> **b)** How many equivalence classes are there?

$\aleph_0$.

# 2.6.1.11

> 
> **a)** What is the equivalence relation $\sim$ generated by $R$?

$\sim$ represents the relation between connected nodes, i.e. which nodes are in
connected components with which other nodes. Each node is in a connected
component with itself (reflexivity), connections in an undirected graph are
two-way connections (symmetry), and two nodes which are connected to a third
node are connected to each other (transitivity).

> **b)** What is the quotient $X/\sim$?

The quotient of $X$ by $\sim$ ($X/\sim$) is the set of equivalence classes of
$\sim$; in this case, the set of connected components.

While it would be harder to intuit from piecewise definitions of $f:W\to X$ and
$g:W\to Y$, the diagram above makes it clear that all the nodes in $X$, $W$, and
$Y$ are a single connected component, i.e. $x_1 \sim w_1 \sim y_1 \sim w_3 \sim
x_3 \sim w_4 \sim y_2 \sim w_2 \sim x_2$. Thus the cardinality of any pushout $P
\stackrel{\cong}{\to} X \sqcup_W Y$ will have $\abs{P} = 1$.


<hr/>

# 2.6.2.5 

> Suppose that $W = \emptyset$; what can you say about $X \sqcup_W Y$?

If $W=\emptyset$, then $\abs{X}= \abs{Y} = 1$, since $W$ is an initial object. Since
$W=\emptyset$, the fiber sum $X \sqcup_W Y$ has no overlap. Thus for any $Z
\stackrel{\cong}{\to} X \sqcup_W Y$, $\abs{Z} = 2$.

<hr/>

# 2.6.2.6 

> Let $W := \N = \\{0,1,2,...\\}$ denote the set of natural numbers, let $X =
> \Z$ denote the set of integers, and let $Y = \\{1\\}$ denote a one-element
> set.  Define $f:W\to X$ by $f(w) = -(w+1)$, and define $g: W\to Y$ to be the
> unique map. Describe the set $X \sqcup_W Y$.

$$
\require{AMScd}
\begin{CD}
W := \N @>{f(w) = -(w+1)}>> X := \Z \\
@V{g}VV @V{i_1}VV \\
Y := \{1\} @>{i_2}>> X \sqcup_W Y
\end{CD}
$$

The fiber sum $X\sqcup_W Y$ is the quotient of $X\sqcup W\sqcup Y / \sim$, which
divides the disjoint union of $X$, $W$, and $Y$ into equivalence classes. Since
$g:W\to Y$ equates all natural numbers in $W$ into one equivalence class, any
pushout $Z \stackrel{\cong}{\to} X \sqcup_W Y$ will have a single element.

# 2.6.2.7

$$
\require{AMScd}

@. @V{\pi_2\circ i}VV @VVV \\
@. X @>>> X \sqcup_R X
\end{CD}
$$

The fiber sum $X \sqcup_R X$ is the set of objects in $X$ which are equivalent
across $\sim_R$, i.e. $\\{x \mid (x,x) \in R$, i.e. $\pi_1(R)$. Because the
equivalence relation $R$ is symmetric, any two objects in $x_1 \sim x_2 \forall
x_1, x_2 \in X \sqcup_R X$.

> **b)** If $i: R \subseteq X \times X$ is not assumed to be an equivalence

If $R_2$ is not an equivalence relation, there is no guarantee that $\pi_1\circ
i \cong \pi_2\circ i$. So the new pushout $X \sqcup_{R_2} X$ is the disjoint sum
of all elements which appear on either side of any pair of values in $R_2$.
This new $R_2$ also generates an equivalence relation $R_{2, \text{gen}}$. We
can infer that the fiber sum on $R_2$ is a subset of the fiber sum on $R_{2,
\text{gen}}$.

> Let $X = \R$ be the set of real numbers. What is the coequalizer of the two
> maps $X \to X$ given by $x \mapsto x$ and $x \mapsto (x+1)$ respectively?

$\text{Coeq}(f,g) = \R$. Under the coequalizer, $f(x)\sim g(x) \implies f(1)\sim
g(1) \implies 1 \sim 2$, and $2\sim 3$, etc. Thus all the real numbers share a
single equivalence class under $X / f(x)\sim g(x)$.

<hr/>

# 2.6.3.3 

> Find a universal property enjoyed by the coequalizer of two arrows.

Since the coequalzier is the dual ofthe equalizer, the universal property
enjoyed by the coequalizer (if present) of two arrows:

$$
\require{AMScd}
\begin{CD}
X @>{f}>{g}> Y @>{q}>> Q \\
@. @. \diagdownarrow{q'} @V{u}VV \\
@. @. Q'
\end{CD}
$$

commutes such that $q\circ f = q' \circ g$.

<hr/>

# 2.6.3.4 

> An initial zet is a set $S$ such that for every set $A$, there exists a unique
> function $S \to A$. Find an initial set.

Recall that the cardinality $\abs{\hbs(S,A)} = \abs{A}^\abs{S}$.

If this value is to be no greater than one for any set $A$, $\abs{S}$ must be
zero. Thus $S = \emptyset$.
