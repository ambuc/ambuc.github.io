> **a)** Come up with some notion of mapping for multisets that generalizes
> functions when the notion is restricted to sets.
> 
> **b)** Suppose that $X = (1,1,2,3)$ and $Y = (a,b,b,b)$, i.e. $X =
> \\{1,2,3\\}$ with $1$ having multiplicity $2$, and $Y = \\{a,b\\}$ with $b$
> having multiplicity $3$. What are all the maps $X\to Y$ in your notion?
