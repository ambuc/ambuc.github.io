> Let $K := \\{BS,a,b,c,...z\\}$, a set having 27 elements. Suppose you want to
> think of $BS \in K$ as the "backspace key" and the elements $a,b,c...,z\in K$ as
> the letter keys on a keyboard. Then the free monoid $\text{List}(K)$ is not
> quite appropriate as a model because we want $[a,b,d,BS] = [a,b]$.
> 
> **a)** Choose a set of relations for which the monoid presented by generators
> $K$ and the chosen relations is appropriate for this application.
> 
> **b)** Under your relations, how does $[BS]$ compare with $[]$? Is that
> suitable?
