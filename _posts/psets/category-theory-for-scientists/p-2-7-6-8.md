> Given sets $X,Y,Z$ and functions $f:X\to Y$ and $g:Y\to Z$, we can compose
> them to get a function $X\to Z$. If $B$ is a set, if $(X,p)$, $(Y,q)$ and
> $(Z,r)$ are relative sets over $B$, and if $f: (X,p) \to (Y,q)$ and $g:
> (Y,q)\to (Z,r)$ are mappings, is there a reasonable notion of composition such
> that we get a mapping of relative sets over $(X,p)\to(Z,r)$? Draw diagrams.
