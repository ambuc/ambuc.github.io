# 3.1.1.21 

> Let's consider the buffer concept again (see Application 3.1.1.20), but this
> time only having size 3 rather than 32. Show using Definitiopn 3.1.1.17 that
> with relations given by $\sim_1$ we indeed have $[a,b,c,d,e,f] = [a,b,f]$ and
> that with relations given by $\sim_2$ we indeed have $[a,b,c,d,e,f] = [a,b,c]$.
