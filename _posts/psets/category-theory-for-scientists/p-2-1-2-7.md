The set $A = \\{1\\}$ satisfies this condition. 
$\abs{\hbs(X, A)} = \abs{A}^\abs{X} = 1^x = 1$.

> **b)** Find a set $B$ such that for all sets $X$ there is exactly one element
> in $\hbs(B, X)$.

The set $B = \emptyset$.

Observe $\abs{\hbs(B,X)} = \abs{X}^\abs{B} = \abs{X}^0 = 1$.
There is only one way to map the empty set; an empty mapping with no arrows
at all.
