> For any $m \in \N$ let $i_m : \N \to \Z$ be the function $i_m(n) = m \ast n$.
> All such functions are monoid homomorphisms $(\N,0,+) \to (\Z,0,+)$. Do any
> monoid homomorphisms $(\N,0,+) \to (\Z,0,+)$ not come in this way? For
> example, what about using $n \mapsto 5\ast n - 1$ or $n \mapsto n^2$ or some
> other function?
