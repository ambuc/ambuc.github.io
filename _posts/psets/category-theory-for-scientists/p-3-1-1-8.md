# 3.1.1.8 

> In both Example 3.1.1.3 and Exercise 3.1.1.6, the monoids $(M,e,\star)$
> satisfied an additional rule called \textit{commutativity}, namely $m\star n =
> n\star m$ for every $m,n \in M$. There is a monoid $(M, e, \star)$ lurking in
> linear algebra textbooks that is not commutative; if you have a background in
> linear algebra try to answer this: what $M$, $e$, and $\star$ might I be
