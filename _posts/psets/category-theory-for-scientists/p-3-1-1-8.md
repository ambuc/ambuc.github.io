For 2x2 matrices $A$ and $B$, it is not the case that $AB=BA$.
However, matrix multiplication does form a monoid:

  - There is an identity element $e$, which is the identity matrix $I$. For 2x2
    matrices, it is always true that $I_2 A = A I_2 = A$.
  - Matrix multiplication is associative; it is always true that $A(BC) =
    (AB)C$.

Here, $M$ is the set of (for example) all 2x2 matrices; $e = I_2$, and $A \star
B = AB$.
