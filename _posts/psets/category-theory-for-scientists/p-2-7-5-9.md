# 2.7.5.9 

> Consider the subobject classifier $\Omega$, the singleton $\\{1\\}$ and the
> map $\\{1\\} \xrightarrow{\text{True}} \Omega$ from Definition 2.7.4.9. Look
> at diagram 2.44 and in the spirit of Exercise 2.7.5.7., come up with a label
> for $\Omega$, a label for $\\{1\\}$, and a label for $\text{True}$. Given a
> label for $X$ and a label for $f$, come up with a label for $A$, a label for
> $i$, and a label for $f'$, such that the English smoothly fits the
> mathematics.
