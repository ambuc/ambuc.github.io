While working at the Champaign-Urbana Community Fab Lab on a previous project, I discovered a sheet of opalescent acrylic. At first transparent, it became unpredictably multicolored when a light was shone through it. I decided it would make a brilliant lamp.

I designed the TARDIS in Illustrator, modeling its proportions after whatever photo references I could find. The edges are connected by well-toleranced finger joints, and the entire body, including the base, are constructed without any glue or sealant. The base was built using an LED, some resistors, and a single D-cell battery.
